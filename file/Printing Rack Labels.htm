<p>Use the Warehouse Rack Labels panel to print the labels for your warehouse.&nbsp; 
You can either print one label at a time or generate all the rack labels you 
will need.</p>
<p>The information required for the rack label is Building, Row, Level, and Bay.  These 
can be letters or numbers, but you cannot mix letters and numbers.  Up to three digits
can be used for each of these, although only one is required.  For example, you can have
building 238 or A, but you cannot use 3892 (too long) or F4 (mixed letters and numbers).</p>
<p>
<h3>Printing an Individual Rack Label</h3>
<p>In the event that one of your existing rack labels becomes damaged, or for 
any other reason that you would need to print only a single rack label, you can 
use the first option on the form.</p>
<p>To print a single rack label, ensure that your DYMO label printer is ready 
and follow these steps (see image above):</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the option '<b>Print Individual Rack Tag</b>' (if not already selected when you entered the form).</li>
<li>Enter the <b>Building</b>, <b>Row</b>, <b>Level</b>, and <b>Bay </b>for the tag.</li>
<li>Click the '<b>Print</b>' button.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Generating all Rack Labels</h3>
<p>When you first create your warehouse or any time you need to print a large 
number of sequential rack tags, you should use to the second option to save 
time.&nbsp; This mode takes the MAXIMUM in each of the fields.&nbsp; For 
example, if, in building one, you have 30 rows, and each of those rows has 5 
levels (denoted by A, B, C, D, or E), and each of those levels in those rows 
have 6 bays, you would put the maximum values in the cells as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the option '<b>Generate All Rack Tags</b>' (if not already selected when you entered the form).</li>
<li>Enter the maximum values for <b>Building</b>, <b>Row</b>, <b>Level</b>, and <b>Bay </b>for the tag.</li>
<li>Your form should look like this:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</li>
<li>Click the '<b>Print</b>' button.</li>
</ol>
		<p>Please note that in this example, according to the last box, that this 
would print 900 rack labels.  These labels should then be applied to their respective
locations within the warehouse for the employees to scan when stocking or pulling
merchandise.</p>
<h3>Limited Generation of Rack Labels</h3>
<p>Finally, if you would like to only print a sub-set of the rack labels that would be 
generated, you can limit the labels by checking the check-boxes below the maximum values
you entered.  For example, suppose you wanted to add a fifth row to an already existing
building 4, which would have 6 levels (denoted by letters) each with 10 bays each, simply
enter building 4, the row to be added, 5, the maximum level, F, and the number of bays, 10.
Then, simply click the check-box underneath the row to limit printing to all levels and rows
within that specified building and row.  This should change the Total Labels to 60.</p>
<img border=0 alt='Printing Rack Labels Panel' src='PrintingRackLabels3.bmp'>
<p>That is 6 levels times 10 bays, all with building 4, row 5 (6 * 10 = 60 tags!!).  Similarly,
if you want to limit it to the buliding, level, or bay, simply click the check-box underneath
that column.  You can use the Total Labels field to verify that you are limiting the printout
the the correct number of labels.</p>
