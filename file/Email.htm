<h1 style = "color:red">Email Config Panel</h1>
You currently have three options for sending email.  

<ul>
 <li>Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express</li>
 <li>via SMTP Host</li>
 <li>Direct</LI>
</ul>

<h3>Aquiring SMTP Host Information - Email Config Panel</h3>
If you are sending via an SMTP host, you will first need to aquire your host address and
authentication.  If you are going through Outlook or Outlook Express, you can skip this step.
<br><br>

This will explain how to aquire your SMTP host information from a computer configured to use 
<a href="#Outlook">Outlook</a> or <a href="#Express">Outlook Express</a> from Microsoft.

<a name="Outlook">
<h4>Aquiring SMTP Host information from Microsoft Outlook</h4>
From the main Outlook screen, Click the <i>Tools</i> menu and select <u>Email Accounts...</u>

<br><br><img src='SMTP-OutlookOK.bmp' /><br><br>

If the wizard comes up with the <b>Add a new e-mail account</b> option selected, you do not have
any email accounts set up on this computer with Outlook and you cannot proceed.<br><br>

Select the <b>View or change existing e-mail accounts</b> and click <b>Next &gt;</b>.  Select one
of the email accounts, and click <b>Change...</b>.<br><br>

From this screen, you can record your SMTP Host information.  Record the following information and
enter it into your WinCDS Email Configuration Panel from the File Menu:<br><br>

<ul>
 <li>Outgoing mail server (SMTP)</li>
 <li>Username</li>
 <li>Password (you will need to supply this yourself, as it will be encrypted on this form).</li>
</ul>

<a name="Express">
<h4>Aquiring SMTP Host information from Microsoft Outlook Express</h4>
From the main Outlook Express screen, go to the <i>Tools</i> menu and select <u>Accounts...</u>.
From the dialog, select the <b>Mail</b> tab.  Select your account and click <b>Properties</b>.  Select
the <b>Servers</b> tab.<br><br>

<br><br>

From this screen, you can record your SMTP Host information.  Record the Outgoing mail (SMTP) server name.
If the checkbox <i>My server requires authentication</i> is checked, then click the settings and
record the settings on the form the appears (either the user name and password, or use the same
as the incoming mail settings).


<h2>Configuring your Email</h2>
Once you have gotten your email settings from your email program, you can enter them into WinCDS.  Below
shows how to enter the SMTP information (if required) and finish configuring your email.

<h3>Sending through Microsoft Outlook</h3>
<img src=Email.bmp /><br>
To send email through your current Microsoft Outlook settings, select this default option.<br><br>

You must have either Outlook or Outlook Express set up on the local machine (the one
where the software is running).  Otherwise, Outlook will receive the email to send,
but it will remain in the outbox and no go anywhere.<br><br>

If you are using Terminal Services, it will use the email settings from the server.

<h3>Sending through SMTP Host</h3>
<img src=Email2.bmp /><br>
You can send through the SMTP host provided by your ISP.  You will need to know your SMTP Host
(and port, if other than 25).  You will also need to know your username and password.<br><br>

For help determining your SMTP Host if you are already using Outlook or Outlook Express, click see
the instructions <a href='SMTP.htm'>here</a>.

<h3>Sending Direct</h3>

See the note on the form.  While this option is available, it will probably fail for 
most major email providers.
