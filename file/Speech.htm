<h1>Speech Recognition</h1>

WinCDS is proud to offer you Speech Recognition built right into the POS software.  This allows you to create many sales entirely without
even touching the keyboard!  How's that for innovation?<br>
<br>
The quality of any Speech Recognition software depends on several factors, including probably first of all the quality of the microphone 
and ambient background noise.  A cheap microphone will not provide enough dynamics to provide adequate recognition and too much
background noise will prove to be too much for the recognition engine to compete with.  Both of are important to consider when
purchasing additional hardware.<br>
<br>

WinCDS recommends purchasing a BlueTooth USB 2.0 EDR dongle for BlueTooth connectivity (if required) and a universal BlueTooth headset
such as the Motorola H780.<br/>
<br/>

Speech Recognition will allow you, at appropriate points in the software, to either speak any text you would have normally typed, 
spell out letter-by-letter a name or email address, or allow you to give a pre-defined command that the software will recognize.

<br/>

To activate speech recognition, you must first install the speech recognition engine and a valid microphone.  After these are setup,
you must create and train a voice profile so that you can obtain the best results out of the speech software.  Both of these steps
are accomplished outside of WinCDS.  For instructions on how to prepare to use Speech Recognition in WinCDS, please

<br/><br/>
Once you are prepared to use the Speech Recognition, all you have to do to turn it on is click the icon:<br/>

A dialog will appear that will stay on your screen the whole time speech recognition is active.  Use it to know what WinCDS is expecting
at any given point and to shut off the speech engine at any time.<br/>

There are three modes for recognition:
<ul>
	<li>Command Mode - The software will only accept pre-defined commands.</li>
	<li>Spelling Mode - The software will take any pre-defined command and allow you to spell out words, letter by letter.</li>
	<li>Dictation Mode - The software will allow you to say words, letters, or a pre-defined command.</li>
</ul>
In addition, if there is information about the quality of the voice stream available to WinCDS such as Too Loud or Too Quiet or No Signal,
it will be displayed in the box.<br/>
<br/>
You can also either pause voice recognition with the <b>Disable</b> button or shut it off completely with the <b>Turn Off</b> button.
