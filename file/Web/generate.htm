<h2>Steps to Establishing a website</h2>
It will take you apporoximately 2-3 hours to do your initial site setup.<br/>
You should be able to begin taking orders as soon as your Merchant Account is established.<br/>
<br/>
Run WinCDS and select Generate Web Pages from the 'Web' Menu off the main form.<br/>
Select all options, and click 'Build'<br/>
<br/>
Establish your items  <font color=white style="font-weight: bold">(You should only ever have to do this once!)</font><br/>
<ul>
	<li>Goto Store Manager (Off of Services Page)
	<li>Select CATALOG MANAGER
	<li>Select 'Manage Your Tables'
	<li>'Create New Table'
        <ol>
	  <li>Step 1: Enter 'items' for Table Name (and any description you want if you desire)
	  <li>Step 2: Select 'Next' to keep the mandatory fields
	  <li>Step 3: Select the following Store Fields:  Caption, Abstract, Label
          <li>        Click 'Next'
	  <li>Step 4: Select the following Shopping Fields:  Product-url, Manufacturer
                Click 'Next'
	  <li>Step 5: Click 'Add Another Custom Field'
		Add the following Custom Fields:  'Department', Format='Text', Required=No, Leave Default Value Blank
                Click 'Next'
	  <li>Step 6: Verify that you have 14 fields in your table.
                Click 'Save'
	</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

Now its time to put items into your Table (This should be done when changes are made to list of items (not changes in available quantity))<br/>
<ul>
	<li>From the CATALOG MANAGER
	<li>Select 'Upload' or 'Upload Items'
	<li>Click the 'Upload' button
	<li>Select the destination table:  'items'
	<li>Choose Action:  Rebuild
	<li>Click 'Browse' and select the items file (e.g.  c:\inventpx\webtemplate\2data.csv)
	<li>Click the 'Upload' button
	<li>In the Warnings and Errors Box, You should see:<br/>
		"No warnings or errors to report. Please choose Commit to update your database."<br/><br/>
	<li>Click 'Commit' to update the database.
	<li>Click 'Rebuild' to confirm the commit action.
	<li>The database is now built, but it is not 'live' yet (usable by the website).
	<li>To make it 'live', now click on 'Publishing', and then 'Publish Catalog'.
	<li>The button should gray-out and the Publish History should indicate that the catalog has been published.
	<li>Click on 'Store Manager' to return.
</ul>
<br/><br/>

Now that you have your items installed, you can install the pages built in WinCDS.<br/>
	Goto the Yahoo File Manager (once you're logged in, it is availble here: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>http://us.1.p.webhosting.yahoo.com/filemanager)</u>
<br/><br/>
	Select 'Upload Files'<br/><br/>

	You need to upload 2 files:  
<ul>		
		<li>c:\inventpx\webtemplate\package.zip
		<li>c:\inventpx\webtemplate\templates\unpack.php
</ul>
        When you're done uploading those two files, return to the File Manager from the File Upload.
	You should see the two files in the directory now down below.
<br/><br/>
	To the right of the file unpack.php should be a link entitled 'View'.<br/>
	Click the 'View' on unpack.php and wait for the page to finish loading.<br/>
	Your website, including all images and directories should now be unpacked into your directory.<br/>
	To verify this, you can reload the file manager page and see all the files unpacked.<br/>
	Additionally, you can now visit your store website:   www.<your-domain-name>.com (e.g.  www.simplifiedposonline.com)<br/>
<br/><br/>
For this next step, you will need to create a new email account to process your order emails:
<ul>
	<li>Goto EMAIL CONTROL PANEL From the Serivces Page
	<li>You should see that you have about 100 email accounts availble to create.
	<li>You can use this process to create as many as you want, although this will only walk you through
	the process required to create the accounts required by our system.
	<li>Click 'Create Address'
	<li>Enter the name for the mailbox (e.g. 'orders').
	<li>You need to create a mailbox, not a mail forward, so click 'Create Mailbox'
	<li>Because WinCDS will read the orders directly from Yahoo, select the option: 'POP Email Only mailbox'
	<li>Click 'Continue'
	<li>Enter the password for the mailbox in both boxes.
	<li>Enter your email address in the 'Send instructions by email' box.
	<li>Click the checkbox agreeing to the 'Terms of Service'.

		<li>Also take note that you can preview your order forms with the button on the left top

		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Under 'Payment Methods' you set up how you want to handle money.
