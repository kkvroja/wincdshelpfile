<p>In order to automatically verify stock levels and process orders in real time from
Yahoo Small Business Solutions,
one copy of the WinCDS program must be running with this form open.  This form
performs two operations.</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Verifies stock levels</li>
<li>Retrieves order emails</li>
</ol>

<h3>Verifying stock levels</h3>
<p>The program opens a port to listen for a connection from the Yahoo server.  Yahoo asks
about a specific Style number and the program with the current stock, and a description
if it is out of stock or non-determinable.</p>
<h3>Retrieving order emails</h3>
<p>The program connects to the specified POP3 server with the specified email account
and password specified under the config and checks to see if there are any current orders.
There isn't any action required.  The program will continue to recheck at a particular
interval of time so long as this form is open.  If this form closes for any reason,
simply re-open it, and it will begin its retrieval cycle again.</p>

<h2>Configuration Panel</h2>
<p>The first time you use this, you should set up the values in the configuration panel.
Click the '<b>Config</b>' button, and you will see the following screen:<br><br>

<br><br>
Simply enter the appropriate values into the boxes.

<h4>Local IP Address</h4>
Can be obtained from your network administrator or through a website such as
<a href="http://www.ipchicken.com">www.ipchicken.com</a>.
<h4>RT Inventory Monitor Port</h4>
Any port number larger than 2048 that is not used by another application should be sufficient.
Either use the default (the default for the program is 4242) or supply your own.  If you have
a network administrator for your local network, that person will probably want to specify this
value.
<h4>Order Retreival POP3 Remote Host</h4>
You should use the specified host and IP number (pop.bizmail.yahoo.com 110) unless specified
otherwise by Yahoo.
<h4>Order Retreival Email Account and Password</h4>
After setting up the email account using the Email Account Manager and designating your
orders to be delievered to this account, enter the account and password into these boxes.
Be sure to include the entire email address (e.g. orders@yourpersonalwebsite.com).
<br>
