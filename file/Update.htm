<h1>Manually check for program updates</h1>
<img src=Update.bmp /><br/><br/>

Your software should update itself automatically overnight once a week.  If you desire to update
your software manually outside of its regular schedule, simply go to the manual update screen.<br><br>

Click <b>Check for Web Updates</b> and the program will process the request and load the current
list of updates, indicating which parts of your software need attention.  You can modify this list
and only obtain the updates you desire by using the checkboxes beside each item.<br><br>

When you are satisfied with your updates, click <b>Process Selected Updates</b>.  Note that this
process may take up to a half hour or more, depending on which updates you selected, your connection
speed, and other factors.  You will be notified when your update is complete.  If you update the
main program, you will be notified at the end of downloading that you need to restart your software
to complete the process.<br><br>

Click <b>Close</b> to exit the manual update panel.<br><br>

Note, if you want to view the actual update data, you can click the URL at the top of the screen and
it will open the URL in your internet browser.  You will see raw XML data which you may not understand,
but this will verify that you are able to connect to WinCDS's website through our software.<br><br>

<font size=-1 color=white>TIP:  The title bar will contain the day of the week that your software will
download the updates.  It is based on your store's name.  It will download early in the morning that
day and should be available for use on that day.
