<p>
If you have purchased a wireless base unit and scanner from Custom Design Software, 
you must enable it in the software under the <a href='Store Setup'>Store Setup page</a>.
Under the options tab, Simply make sure that the check box for the wireless base unit
is checked:<br>

</p>
<p>
There are two relevant settings to configure:
<ul>
<li>Server Port</li>
<li>Require Password</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
<h3>Server Port</h3>
To run the wireless scanner, the software will listen for a connection from the
scanner unit on the port you specify.  Any number greater than 2048 should work,
however if you have a network administrator, they may wish to specify a number
other than the default (the default for this value is 3000).
</p>
<p><h3>Require Password</h3>
The wireless units can also be required to supply a password to the software to
prevent unauthorized access. To require the individual scanners to supply a
password upon connecting to the system, check the checkbox and enter your new
password into the the box provided.  After checking the box and entering the password,
be sure to distribute the password to all of the operators of the hand-scanners so
they can input it into their scanner.

<p><h3>Server IP Address</h3>
You can also note the computer's IP address.  You will need to enter this number into
all of the scanner units as well so that they will be able to find the server computer
on the network.  If you change any networking parameters which could cause a change in your computer's IP address, you can either restart your software to update this field or simply double click on it to refresh its value.  However, this field is for your information only.  It is not used by the software.

<p><h3>Activity Log</h3>
You can view the activity log to verify that your scanner units are communicating
with the server.  However, it is not usually necessary to view.<br/>
<h5>Clearing the Activity Log</h5>
If you desire to clear the activity log at any time, simply double click on the large white text-box.
