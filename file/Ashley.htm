WinCDS can provide automatic updating of items and prices through Ashley's Ashley Direct FTP interface.
<br/><br/>
Using this feature, the software can use the credentials you supply from Ashley,
and connect automatically to their server and download an updated price-list, complete
with prices, descriptions, and the most current images.
<br/><br/>
<h3>Ashely Configuration</h3>
To use this feature, first enter your login information in the Store Setup, under the
Services tab, in the Ashley section.  Once configured, return to the File Menu, and
under Utilities, Select <b>Ashley Maintenance</b>.
<br/><br/>
<h4>Master Inventory File</h4>
First, ensure that your "initial values" for pricing the new items are entered in
the boxes on the right.  These will populate the List and On Sale prices, as Ashley
only supplies you with unit price.  The other values, including freight, landed, and
prices are calculated on the basis of this cost and these initial values.
<br/><br/>
When you click the <b>Master Inventory File</b> button, the software will download the current 
Ashley master item catalog file (also referred to as an 888 file).  
<br/><br/>
Once loaded into the display, you can check which items you wish to import and/or update 
simply by clicking the box on the left and making it a check-mark.  To select or deselect
all items, click the empty box in the top left corner, on the heading line.
<br/><br/>
Once all your desired items are selected, simply click the <b>Import</b> button to begin the process.
<br/><br/>
<h4>Synch Images</h4>
To import the images, the process is the same.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:10px;color:blue;'><b>NOTE:</b> Due to file size concerns, Ashley only permits the images to be available on their server
for a 24-hour time-span.  To synch your images, first, contact Ashley, and request their availability.  Once availability is secured,
in the time window allotted, process your images.</span>
<br/><br/>
Click the <b>Synch Images</b> button.  The software will download the current catalog, and allow you to make your selection of which images you wish to update.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:10px;color:green;'><b>TIP:</b> Click the top left box on the top of the grid in the heading line to select 'all images'.</span>
<br/><br/>
When you click <b>Import</b>, the software will download all the selected images that are available on the Ashley server,
and place them into your picture directory (InventPX).
<br/><br/>
<h4>Additional Options</h4>
While not necessary, this part of WinCDS also provides you with some additional options, in case you wish to download the images, or the 888 file
separately, and process them at a later date.  One option, if you choose, while unsupported by WinCDS, is to connect to the Ashley FTP server
directly via an FTP client, and download the files yourself.  Choosing this option allows you to download these files at your convenience, perhaps
overnight or over a weekend, if your connection is slow, and process these files at your convenience sometime in the future.
<br/><br/>
To use either option, simply select the check-box on the left, and either enter the path to the 888 file (begins with "888-" and ends with ".xml"), 
or the directory where you downloaded the Ashley images to prior.
<br/><br/>
Neither of these options are necessary, and are advanced options for those who know how to download these images on their own, or are specifically
instructed to do so by WinCDS.
