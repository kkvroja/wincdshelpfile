<h2>Loading Original Inventory</h2>
You can load your original inventory in one of two ways:
<ul>
 <li>Enter Quantities Manually</li>
 <li>Import From Barcode Scanner</li>
</ul>

Both of these will update your original quantities to reflect your current levels.
<br><br><br>

<h3>Enter Quantities Manually</h3>
If you select <b>Enter Quantities Manually</b>, Click this to load the original inventory 
from your <b>Physical Inventory Worksheets</b>.<br/>
<br/>
Select each vendors in the drop down. The software will automatically bring up every 
inventory item in the order of your physical work sheet by vendor. Click the <b>Ok</b>
button. All the items from that vendor will automatically come up on the 
screen.<br/>
<br/>
To add Inventory, put the quantity in the quantity box and also, 
distribute the quantity in each location. The allocation figure will 
automatically increase by the quantity you put in each location. The sum 
of each location must match the Quantity. Be sure to click the <b>Apply</b> 
button for each item. Click the <b>Next &gt;</b> button to move to the next item for 
that vendor and repeat the process for each vendor.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Import From Barcode Scanner</h3>
If you have purchased our Data Collector, you can 
automatically enter your inventory. <br/>
<br/>
Before you begin, the you will need barcodes for each of your items.<br/>
While you are entering the basic inventory information (style, manufacturer, 
description, etc) print out a retail price tag for the floor. These tags will 
have barcodes for all your floor stock.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have barcodes, you should:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Set the scanner to receive by selecting <b>Stock Setup</b> under <i>Warehouse Tracking</i>.</li>
<li>Scan each item in the quantities that reflect your inventory.  When you have fully
scanned all of your inventory (or a distinct sub-set).</li>
<li>Go to <i>File</i> | <i>Load Original Inventory</i> | <i>Import from Barcode Scanner</i>.</li>
From this screen, loading the inventory is a three-step process:
 <ol>
 <li>First, click <b>Import Data</b> to pull the scanned items from your device.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Select the scanner type and click <b>Import</b>.
  <li>The status bar at the bottom of the form should reflect the records received.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Close</b> from the <u>Import</u> form.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Second, click <b>Compare Inventory</b> to generate the discrepancy report from the newly imported data.
You are now ready to import the new levels.</li>
 <li>Finally, click <b>Import Discrepancies</b>.  You will be prompted for the newly created
discrepancy report:<br/><br/>

  <ul>
  <li>Select the most current file (check date) in the Invent folder</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Open</b> button.</li>
  <li>Wait until the software prompts you that the Import procedure is complete and how many items were imported.<br/><img src="Load Orig Inventory Done.bmp"/></li>
  </ul>
<br/>
 </ol>
 <li>Your new stock quantities should be reflected in your database.  You now will only have to add the stock in the warehouse, if applicable.</li>
 <li>Click <b>Menu</b> to return to the Main Menu.
</ul>
