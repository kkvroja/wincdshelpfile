To prevent customers from &quot;shopping&quot; your prices, the software can be set to 
eliminate printing the factory style numbers on the price tags.

<br/><br/>Instead, if you have a private store cost code, the software will automatically print the 
style number in your code, thus preventing the consumer from seeing the 
manufactures style number.

<br/><br/>
For example, if you replace the numbers <b>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0</b> with a code such as <b>B U Y&nbsp; F O R&nbsp; C A S H,</b> 
then the letter B becomes a 1, the letter U becomes a 2 and so on.

<br/><br/>
The only time you will see this code is on the price tags. The salesperson 
will have to transpose the code to enter a sale or check Inventory.
However, if you use the Mini Barcode Scanners available from Custom Design 
Software, you never have to use the coded style numbers on the retail price 
tags. The scanners will do the work for you.
