<p align="justify">If you want to have a color picture of the item printed on 
the retail Large Price Tag, select this option.
<br/><br/>If the software finds the 
picture in its database, then the picture will be printed on the retail Large 
Price Tag.
<br/><br/>
If there is no picture found, it will print out a standard price tag with your preprinted design.&nbsp; </p>
