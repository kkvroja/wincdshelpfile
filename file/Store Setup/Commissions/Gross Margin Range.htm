If you pay commissions on a sliding scale by Gross Margin, enter the ranges 
from lowest to highest.&nbsp; Add the commission for each range.<br/><br/>

Note that the first box is less than or equal to, while the second box is less than.  This means that, for the example shown,
a Gross Margin of 10 to 14.9 would pay a rate of 3%.  A Gross Margin of 15%, however, would move up into the 3.5% bracket.<br/><br/>

Finally, you can either put in a 99 for the highest end, or leave it blank.  That means, anything that pays a Gross Margin of
45 or higher would receive the highest commission rate, or 5%.<br/><br/>

You can either do ranges as 10 to 14.9, where the next range starts at 15, or show the overlap as in the example, where it is
understood that anything that reaches the next bracket will be counted in the higher commissions range.
