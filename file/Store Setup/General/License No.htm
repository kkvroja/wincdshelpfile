A license number will be included with each purchase of the program.&nbsp; 
This limits the stores you can sell from.<br/><br/>

Enter the License code exactly as given by WinCDS, if it has not been entered for you.<br/><br/>

You can add stores at any time.  WinCDS can handle many locations at once.  If you wish to increase the number
of stores, contact WinCDS and obtain a new license code for the number of stores you need.
