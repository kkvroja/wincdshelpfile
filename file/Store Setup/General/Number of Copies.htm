At the left, bottom corner of the form, you can select how 
many copies of the Bill Of Sale you want printed for each sale. When you 
get the software, it will be set to 1 copy. After you enter all your 
Inventory, the next job is to enter all your sales that are undelivered at the 
time. During this period, you only need one copy of the Bill Of Sale.<br><br>

When you are up and running, you would want at least 2 copies printed. The 
sales are printed in this order:<br><br>

<ul>
 <li>File Copy</li>
 <li>Customers Receipt</li>
 <li>Delivery Copy</li>
 <li>Sales Persons copy</li>
</ul>
