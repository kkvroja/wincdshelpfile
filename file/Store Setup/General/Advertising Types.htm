<h3>How the Advertising Types Work in the software</h3>
You can personally configure the Advertising Types in our software.<br/><br/>

To use this feature, the salesperson must simply select from the advertisting drop down.
When a new sale is written, the salesperson can enter the information in the box on the
sales slip to answer the question: &quot;How did the Customer Come Into 
the Store?&quot;.  This is all the salesperson must do in addition to creating a normal sale.<br/><br/>

Then, at the end of the month, or when ever you choose, you 
can run the <a href="..\..\..\Order\Reports\Advertising Report.htm">Advertising Reports</a> to 
get your Advertising statistics. 
<br><br>

<h3>Setting up your Advertising Types</h3>

<ol>
<li>To enter the Advertising types, click on the drop down labeled <i>Advertising</i>.</li>
<li>Select the type to change (e.g. Type 1) so it turns blue.</li>
<li>Then in the empty box labeled <u>Enter Advertising Types</u>, type in the 
correct type, for example, <i>Radio</i>.</li>
<li>Hit the tab key to make the replacement.</li>
<li>Do the same for the balance of the advertising types.</li>
<li>When complete, <font color=RED>click on <b>Apply</b> on the form to save the changes.</font></li>
</ol>

You must do this for all stores in the chain. Be sure to save the changes in each store.<br/>
When you are finished you can click <b>Menu</b> to exit the setup screen.<br/>
