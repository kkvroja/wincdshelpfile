WinCDS's has the capability to track all of your employees and allow each of them access
only the the portions of the software you desire to allow them to access-each with their
own password.


<h2>Entering your Sales Staff</h2>

<img src="Sales Staff Setup.bmp"/>
<br/><br/>
Enter each member of your sales staff:
<ul>
  <li>Enter the employee's name</li>
  <li>
    Enter an employee number for each employee.  If this employee is not a sales agent,
    leave this field blank.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the agent is paid commission, enter the commission percentage in the 
    third field.
  </li>
</ul>

Be sure to click <b>Apply</b> to save any changes.

<h2>Password Setup</h2>
To change an employee's password, click the employee's name, followed by the 
Change Password button. Two password entry boxes will appear, and the 
Change Password button will change to Save Password. You do not need the 
employee's current password to use this function.<br/><br/>

Change Permissions is used to alter the employee's group memberships. 
When this button is used, a selection screen will pop up listing the available 
groups, with the current memberships pre-selected. These groups determine 
which areas of the program the user's password will allow access to. See 
the User Groups section for more information.<br/><br/>

User accounts can now be deactivated, rather than deleted. To 
deactivate an account, select the user's name and click Disable Account. 
To reactivate an account, check the Show Disabled Accounts option and select the 
user's name. The Disable Account button will be replaced with an Enable 
Account button.
<br/><br/>


<h2>User Groups</h2>
User Groups control access to various parts of the WinCDS 
program. Certain menu items, such as Store Setup, may require password 
authentication. Sales Staff can be members of many groups.<br/><br/>

<h4>WinCDS Default Groups</h4>
WinCDS begins with several default user groups:<br>
<table bgcolor=#BBBBFF border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=2 align=center>
<tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td>Group Name</td><td>Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>Administrators</td> <td>Have access to every part of the program</td></tr>
<tr><td>Office Staff</td>   <td>Have access to the inventory control, ordering, and payments</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sales Staff</td>    <td>Have access to sale creation, adjustment, and viewing sections</td></tr>
<tr><td>Warehouse Staff</td><td>Are allowed to schedule and complete deliveries</td></tr>
<tr><td>Everybody</td>      <td><font size=-1 color=brightred>* (See Below)</font></td></tr>
</table>
<br/><br/>

<h4>The Everybody Group</h4>
The <u><font size=+1>Everybody</font></u> group is used in conjunction with the Security 
Level setting found on the General Page of Store Set Up. Privileges granted to the 
Everybody group are handled differently when the computer is accessible to customers.
<ul>
 <li>In Office Computer mode, program areas allowed to Everybody do not require a password to 
enter.</li>
 <li>In Sales Floor mode, these functions will accept a password from 
any active user account.</li>
</ul>
This prevents customers from accessing sensitive 
store data.<br/>
<br/>

<h4>Custom Groups</h4>
In addition, you may create Custom Groups. These may have 
any name, and any one-character abbreviation. No two groups may share an 
abbreviation, and they may only be deleted (not changed) after they have been 
saved. The default group names and abbreviations can not be changed.<br/><br/>

<h2>Changing User Groups</h2>
Custom Design Software can allow you to customize each user group. 
Each user group is preconfigured to allow permissions for each group. 
However, you can click on <i><b>Change User Accounts</b></i> and modify 
each User Group as seen below. <br/><br/>
For a description of the Security Zones and what they do, see the
<a href='SecurityZones.htm'>Security Zones</a> Page.
<br/><br/>
Be sure to click apply to save any 
changes.<br/><br/>

When you have completed entering 
or changing information, including passwords and group memberships. 
Click <b>Apply</b> to save the <i>Sales Staff</i> for each store.


<br/><br/>

<h2>Security Level</h2>
The final step is setting the Security level on each computer which is located 
on the General Tab of Store Set Up.

<br/><br/><img src='SecurtiyLevel.bmp' /><br/><br/>

The Security Level option determines how often the program asks for passwords.<br/>
<ul>
 <li>No Passwords disables all passwords checks.<br/>
     This is not recommended for active stores, as it leaves all the 
     financial information visible to all users.
 </li>
 <li>Sales Floor mode assumes the computer is in an area accessible to customers, 
     and will require passwords for most functions.<br/>
 </li>
 <li>Office mode assumes the computer is in a physically 
     secure environment, where only trusted personnel can use it. In this 
     mode, non-sensitive functions do not require passwords.<br/>
 </li>
</ul>
<br/>
The program areas that Sales Floor and Office modes 
protect are configurable through the User Groups screen. These modes 
only affect areas permitted to the Everybody group.
<br/><br/>
Click <b>Apply</b> to save the <i>Security Level</i> for each store.
