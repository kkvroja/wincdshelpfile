<br/><br/>
WinCDS now allows you to make your nightly backup automatically, off-site, via the Amazon Web Services, or Amazon Cloud Storage.
<br/><br/>
To enable this feature, contact WinCDS for authorizing credentials which will be installed on your system, and WinCDS will automatically back up your entire store via the internet to Amazon's safe and secure servers.
<br/><br/>
Not only will you be protected from catasrophes, you will also have a few months worth of backups at any time, just in case you need to go back and review a your data on a certain day.
<br/><br/>
We never plan to have to use it, but with Amazon Web Services, you can be sure that your data, once backed up by Amazon, is as secure as it can be.  Plus, you can access it from anywhere, because it's always on the web!
<br/><br/>
<h4>Installation</h4>
For a first time installation, if not done for you by WinCDS, click on <b>Install AWS</b>.  Select whether you wish to install the 32-bit or 64-bit software, and let the AWS-CLI installation process complete.
<br/><br/>
When done, install the credentials under the Configure button, as instructed by WinCDS.
