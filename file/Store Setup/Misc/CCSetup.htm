<h1>Integrated Credit Card Processing</h1>

In this section, you can select and configure Credit Card swiping for this computer.<br>
First, you must have an account through one of our Credit Card providers.
<ol>
<li>X-Charge</li>
<li>TransFirst, LLC</li>
</ol>
<br/>
Select the Credit Card processor you want from the drop down.  Additionally, ON EACH WORKSTATION,
after you have set up the server, you must click the "Use CC Machine" checkbox if this computer will
have a physical Credit Card swiper attached.  This must be done on a per-workstation basis, as not
computers will always have a credit card swiper attached.
<br/><br/>
After you have selected your company, the box will change to one of the options.
<br/><br/>
<h3>X-Charge</h3>

up transction directories, if the default values are not sufficient, please use the Credit Card Management panel.

<h3>Transaction Central (TransFirst, LLC)</h3>

You must enter your merchant ID (TCID) and RegKey.  Additionally, if you do not want to support American Express or
Discover, make sure these boxes are cleared.
