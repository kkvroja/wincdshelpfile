<h1>Speech Setup - Speech Recognition</h1>
These steps are only required for the initial setup of Speech Recognition.  These are steps you will have to perform outside
of the WinCDS software.<br/><br/>

To prepare for Speech Recognition, first install the SAPI 5.1 engine included on the WinCDS distribution CD or
download a copy of it from the WinCDS website.<br/><br/>
To install a new BlueTooth device, first, start at the Control Panel.  Select BlueTooth Devices.  Set the headset to pairing mode.
Click the <b>Add</b> button.  It will find it on the screen.<br/><br/>
Once the Speech Recognition engine is installed and you have successfully attached a microphone, you must set up a voice
profile.  From the Control Panel, select Speech.  Either use the default profile or create your own.  Select your microphone on the
Audio Input at the bottom and click Train to train your speech profile.  It will take a one-time commitment of approximately 20-30
minutes to train your profile.  You can do more training sessions to improve recognition quality, but it is not required.<br/><br/>
Once you have completed these steps, you should restart you computer.  Afterwrds, you are ready to use Speech Recognition inside
of WinCDS!
