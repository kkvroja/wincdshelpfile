<h1>Late Charges and Notices</h1>
<img src='LateCharges.bmp' align='right' />
<p align="justify">The software is set up to run Late Charge Notices and automatically post Late 
Charges to customer accounts 3 times a month.&nbsp; This will lighten the work 
load and balance cash flow evenly throughout the month. All accounts are set up 
with there own due date when the account is set up.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">Accounts are set up to be either Due on the 1st, Late on the 6th, Due on the 
10th Late on the 16th., or Due On the 20 Late on the 26th.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">Therefore the <b>Late Charge Report is run on the 6th, 16th, and the 26th.</b>&nbsp; 
The computer will go through each account, analyze if the customer is late, and 
if so, print out a self address Late Charge Notice. The computer automatically 
applies Late Charges to the account.&nbsp; If you don't want to send any mail to 
certain accounts, you can go into <i><b>Installment, Edit Account </b></i>and 
uncheck the option <b><i>Send All Mail.&nbsp; </i></b>This is done on an 
individual basis.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">The software can also be adjusted to give 10 days Grace 
period.&nbsp; See Store <i><b>Set Up, Options, Grace Period.&nbsp; </b></i> <br>
