<h1>Old Account Setup</h1>
To setup previously existing accounts, click <i><b>Installment</b></i>: <i><b>Old Account Setup</b></i>. 
An <i>Add / Edit Customers</i> form will appear.<br/>

<ul>
<li> Enter the customer's telephone number (it will be formatted for you).  Click <b>OK</b>.
<li>If this is a new customer, a message box will appear asking for confirmation. If you entered the wrong phone number, try again.<br/>
<b>Note:</b> If this is a repeat customer, but the telephone number he/she gave you is not showing up in the computer, ask him/her if there is another telephone number you can try.
<li>Enter the customer's First and Last name, Address, and any other important information. Only enter the <i>Ship To</i> information if it is different from the <i>Billing Address</i>. Do not fill in <i>Ship To</i> if it is the same as <i>Billing Address</i>.
<li>Click <b>OK</b> to continue.  The <u>Payment Setup</u> form will appear:<br/>
<p><img src="AccountSetup.bmp" style='float:right;'/><br/>
<br/>
<b>NOTE:</b>Be <b>extremely</b> careful in setting the delivery date. The entire 
ageing process is set up against this date. If you want to change the 
payment first due date, click on the lower date button and then advance the 
date. In either case, the actual <u>due date</u> will automatically adjust for 
the payment date. There are three Payment Due Dates setup in the software. This is to level out your workload, and even your cash flow!<br/>
<li>You can choose to enter a manual <i>Account Number</i>, or click <b>Auto A/R Number</b> if you wish to have the computer automatically 
generate a number for you. It is recommended that you use 
you old account numbers, if you have them, and later switch to automatic A/R Numbers. Enter 
each field and Tab off to the next field. As you enter information, the 
computer will automatically recalculate the Payment.<br/><br/>
<b>Note:</b> Take extra care to enter these numbers exactly as on the original 
account card so all the balances and figures match the existing contracts 
including the ageing.  If the payment or finance charge is slightly off due to rounding of your old software,
you change the values to exactly match.
<li>
As you fill in each field, and use the <i>Tab</i> key to proceed to the next field, the <i>Payment</i> field will automatically 
re-calculate the data.
<li>The <i>Documentation Fee</i> may already be setup in the software. If so, this field will automatically 
be filled in. If you need to change it, tab down to that field, and enter the new value.
<li>If you sold any type of insurance with the sale, enter the original values in
either <i>Life Insurance</<i>Accident Insurance</i></b>, or <i>Property
Insurance</i>, respectively. If we have the formulas for your 
insurance, they will pop up automatically by default. Then if the customer 
declines insurance, uncheck the insurance. The payment will automatically 
recalculate.
<li>Select the field, <i>Additional Payments Made</i>. This is where you
enter the total value of all <b>Additional </b>Payments made after the original 
deposit. Do not include Late Charges here.
<li>If the customer has any outstanding Late Charges, enter the total value in
the <i>Balance Due Late Charge</i>.
<li>If the customer was given any special terms (Same as Cash), and the terms are
still effective, enter the <u>total</u> number of months (not remaining months)
given. For example: Customer was give 6 Months Same as Cash, so enter a <b>6</b>
in the <i>Cash Opt.</i> dropdown box (even if today is three months into
the contract).
<li>Since these are old accounts, you don't need to print out the contract, so
just click <i><b>Apply</b></i> to save.
</ul>
<b>Tip:</b> Always press <b>Tab</b> after changing the value in a field. This will cause the computer to re-calculate the <b><i>Payment</i></b> field.
<br>
The computer will prompt you to enter additional contracts.
