<img src='AccountScreen-7.bmp' style='float: right;'/>
Here is the account Payment and View screen. <br/><br/>There are seven parts to this screen:<br/><br/>
<ol>
 <li><a href='#one'>Customer and Account Information</a></li>
 <li><a href='#two'>Terms and Conditions</a></li>
 <li><a href='#thr'>Balance and Payments</a></li>
 <li><a href='#fou'>Ageing and Commands</a></li>
 <li><a href='#fiv'>Method of Payment</a></li>
 <li><a href='#six'>Move Records</a></li>
 <li><a href='#sev'>Letter To Customer</a></li>
</ol>
<br/>
<br/>
The sections are explained below:<br/><br/>

<a name='one'></a>
<h1>1 - Customer and Account Information</h1>
This sections contains the information about the customer, as well as the account status.  
At the top is the account number as well as the status indicating whether this account is Open, Closed, Void, Write off,
or another status.  You cannot change anything in this box while the form is in Payment and View mode.  To be able
to change the status, you must go to the <a href='Edit Accounts.htm'>Edit Accounts</a> screen.<br/>
The status will automatically change to <u>Closed</u> when the account is paid off or <u>Void</u> is the contract is voided.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, you can click on <b>View Cust. History</b> in the lower right of this box to see all transactions from all Ar Accounts from this customer.

<br/>
<a name='two'></a>
<h1>2- Terms and Conditions</h1>
This sections displays the original terms of the contract.  This information is only editable under the 
<a href='Edit Accounts.htm'>Edit Accounts</a> screen.  It shows the original delivery date, date of first last payment,
as well as original financing options and late fees.<br/>
<br/>
From this box, you can reprint contract information for the customer or your file.  You can click:
<ul>
<li><b>Reprint Contract</b> - Reprint the installment contract.</li>
<li><b>Reprint Coupons</b> - Reprint the customer's coupon book.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<br/><br/>
<h4>Payment Summary Box:</h4>
<img src='PaymentSummary.bmp'><br/><br/>
In the Orange box, you can view the payment summary for this customer.  
Each character represents one month of customer history.  The first character represents the
account payment status at the date shown directly above the box (calculated to be the
most recent late date adjusted for Grace period).  The next character represents the account
status for the previous month, one month prior to the date shown.  The third character is
two months ago.
<br/><br/>
The box is formatted to show 12 months per line, so the start of the second line will show 
one year prior, followed by one year and one month, followed by one year and two months, and so on.
<br/><br/>
The individual characters are interpreted as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 bgcolor=pink style="margin-left: 30px; border-color:black;">
<tr><td>1</td><td>Account was current</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Account was 1 payment behind</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Account was 2 payments behind</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Account was 3 payments behind</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Account was 4 or more payments behind</td></tr>
<tr><td>Blank</td><td>No payment history for this month (account was likely not open then).</td></tr>
</table>
<br/><br/>
Take the following example for the 1st 12 months of a contract with a first payment late date of 1/21, 
with a monthly payment of $100.00, and a late charge of $5.00:
<style>
<!--
.PayHistoryDate {background: white; color:black;}
.PayHistory {text-align:left;padding-left: 15px;color:black;background-color:rgb(255,224,192);font-weight:bold;}
-->
</style>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 bgcolor=black style="margin-left: 30px; border-color:white;color:white;text-align: right;">
<tr>
        <td width=65>Date</td>
        <td width=65>Paid</td>
        <td width=150>Arrears</td>
        <td>Payment Codes on Date</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class='PayHistoryDate'>1/21</td><td>100.00</td><td>0.00</td><td class='PayHistory'>1</tr></tr>

</table>

<h4>Things to Note:</h4>
From the above example, notice that as the customer misses payments (e.g., March & April), the current number (the left-most one) increase,
but it also shows the trend.  On 4/21, for example, the code would show "3211", meaning, while they are 2 months
behind now, they were one month behind the previous payment, and made the first two payments successfully.
<br/><br/>
Paying off the balance lowers the numbers. For example on 11/21, the code goes from 3211... in October,
to 13211...  This means they are now current, having paid the two previous months off, as well as the current.  
This is in contrast to the partial payoff on
5/21, where only paid the current month and one previous month.  In that instance, the code was "23211"
indicating an improvement, but still in arrears.
<br/><br/>
From this simple status indicator, you can quickly determine the health of 
any given contract, see patterns of delinquency, and decide how to repond accordingly.

</table>

<h3>Note: Pay on Late Charges</h3>
Paying on Late Charge will decrease the Late Charge Balance. If you need 
to pay on a Late Charge, enter the Late Charge payment In the Late Charge 
Payment Box. As in the example below, the customer owes a total of 
$928.50. Entered is the monthly payment of $75.71 for the current month
and $10.00 to catch them up on the late charges.  This will bring the account
up to date.<br/>
