<p align="justify">When a customer already has an open AR Account, the Add On Account form appears to allow you to select the new account mode.</p>
<img src='AddOnAcc.bmp' width='484' height='204' />
<p align="justify">Given the configuration of your installment settings, you will have one or more of the following options enabled:

<ul>
<li><b>Add On Account</b> - Adds the new sale balance onto the existing account.  The account number is preserved, and the combined balance of the old account and the new sale are combined to replace the original contract details.<br/><br/><span style='font-size:10px;color:green'>NOTE:  This option is not available if you export your installment accounts to the Credit Bureau.</span><br/><br/></li>
<li><b>Add On To New</b> - Combines the existing balance of the selected account with the balance of the new sale under a AR account number.  The original account is closed, and further reporting shows the account to be Paid In Full and current as of time of payoff.  The new account is the only account with payments, and both accounts are combined into a single monthly (or weekly) payment.<br/><br/></li>
<li><b>New Account</b> - Creates a new account for the new sale balance.  Two open accounts result, and two payments per period are expected from the customer.  This results in two completely separate accounts.<br/><br/></li>
</ul>

To process the account, if selecting either <i>Add On Account</i> or <i>Add On To New</i>, first select 
the account to Add on to, then click the command option on the left signifying the process to use.
