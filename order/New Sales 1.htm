<h3>Customer Lookup</h3>
To create a new sale, click <b>New Sales</b> from the Order Entry menu.
A "Check for Prior Sales" form will appear. 
Enter the customer's telephone number in the following format: <b>3024933842</b>.
It will be automatically formatted as you type.

<h3>Customer Information</h3>
Choose <b>Ok</b> to continue.<br><br>

If this is a new customer, a message box will show up asking "Name not in database: Try again?".
If you entered the wrong phone number, choose <b>Yes</b>; otherwise, choose <b>No</b> to continue. 

<h3>Delivery or Pick-up</h3>
If the customer's record is found, the next step would be to set the customer up for Delivery or Pick-Up, if necessary.  
Click on the <i>Delivery</i> check box.  
A calendar will open up to allow you to select the delivery or pick up date.  
<br><br>
<font color='green' size='-1'><b>NOTE:</b> If the customer is taking the item with them at the time of sale, or it is a special order, skip this step.</font>
<br><br>
It will default to None.  
The date can be set later when the Special Order is received or the customer is ready for delivery.
See, Inventory, <a href="../Inventory/Check%20Order%20Status.htm">Check Order Status</a> to set up a later delivery or pick up date.  
Checking the <i>Delivery</i> of <i>Pick-Up</i> check box <b>DOES NOT DELIVER THE MERCHANDISE</b>.

<h3>Status</h3>

The status below the Sale No. always defaults to "New" on a New Sale under order entry.
<br><br>
When you go to View Sale under Order Entry, that Status below the sale number changes depending on the status the sale is in and this tells the store manager/salesperson the status of the sale.
<br><br>
All sales first go to Open status on the View Sale (Except if its a Lay A Way sale).

Now, any sale other than Lay A Way or StoreFinanced will show up as Open initially.

<h3>Pricing and Advertizing</h3>
Under Status, there are two blank Dropdown boxes. 
<b>Leave these blank by default.</b> 
If the customer receives special pricing, or is a wholesale customer, choose the appropriate pricing option in the first box. Pricing is as follows:  
The prices that come up on the order are calculated over Landed Cost.   

<ul>
 <li>Customer: on sale price</li>
 <li>Resale 1: 10% over landing cost</li>
 <li>Resale 2: 15% over landing cost</li>
 <li>Resale 3: 20% over landing cost</li>
</ul>

 The second drop down contains several user-definable categories. You can use these categories for the mailing list, to determine which advertisements bring in the most customers. 
 <br><br>
