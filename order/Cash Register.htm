Custom Design Software offers a optional interface to do Cash &amp; Carry Sales similar to a department store cash register.  
<font color=green>NOTE: To use this sales interface, you need a POS Printer and a keyboard wedge barcode scanner.</font><br>
<font color=yellow>NOTE: We also sell a cash drawer which opens as the sale is made (see our price list). This interface is extremely useful if you sell a lot of accessories and customers bring these items to the counter.</font>
<br><br>
<h3>Starting the Cash Register interface</h3>
To open the Cash Register (for Cash &amp; Carry sales only), click <b>Cash Register</b> on the <i>Order Menu</i>.
The Cash Register form will open.

<h3>Settting the default POS Printer (first time only)s</h3>
The first time you use the Cash Register interface, you need to set the default POS printer.  
From the printer list, find the POS Printer, (use the slider for more printer options) and click on the printer.  
Next, click on <b>Always Use This Printer </b>and the printer option will be saved.  
Your logo or customer address will appear in the printer setup area.
<br><br>
<font color=white><b>NOTE:</b> If you ever need to change your default POS Printer, double click on the address area and the printer options will reappear.</font>
<br><br>
 To use the Cash Register, scan the first item with the scanner (you can also type in the style number).  
 The following form will appear to allow you to enter the quantity:

 If the quantity of 1 is <b>Ok</b>, click or press <b>Apply</b>.  
If the customer bought more than one item, type over the 1 and enter the correct quantity.  
The computer will re-calculate the sale.  
Repeat this for any additional items.  
If any items are to be removed  from the sale, click on <b>Return</b> and the item will be taken off the sale.   
After the last item is selected, click on <b>Payment</b> and the payment options will be available:

To change, click the dropdown and select the appropriate card.  
Click <b>Apply</b> to post the payment.  

<h3>Finishing the Sale</h3>
On the final screen, click on <b>Finish Sale</b> which prints out the receipt. 
If you want to leave the software in this Cash Register mode, leave the screen alone.   
Otherwise, click on <b>Menu</b> to return to the <i>Main Menu</i>.   

<h3>Next Sale</h3>
When you click on <b>Next Sale</b> the screen clears and you are ready for the next sale.   
<font color=green><i><b>Note:</b></i>  There is no duplicate receipt printed for the store.</font>
The Cash &amp; Carry sale creates its own normal Bill Of Sale and may be viewed under <i>View Sale</i> on the <i>Order Entry</i> menu.
All inventory is immediately reduced and delivered in the software.
