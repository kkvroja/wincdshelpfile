<h1>Advertising Report</h1>
Assuming you have set up your default Advertising Types in 
the <i><b>Store Setup</b></i>, and either have your sales staff select 
Advertising Type in the new sale drop down or are forced to select an 
Advertising Type in the drop down, this is what activates this report.&nbsp; The 
question is &quot;How did the customer come into the store&quot;.

<br><br>
Note:&nbsp; In the <i><b>Store Setup</b></i>, you can set an 
option to force an advertising selection.

<br><br>

First, Set the date for the time period you want statistics 
on. Next, if you have multiple stores, select the store you want the 
report for in the drop down.&nbsp; Checking the first option gives a more 
condensed report because the cities can be spelled out in many ways; i.e., 
Michigan, Mi, Mich.&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; So checking the first option combines all 
cities with the same zip code alphabetically.&nbsp;&nbsp; Option 2, <i><b>Sort 
report by Zip Cod</b></i>e gives your list in zip code order.&nbsp; </p>

Each page of the report is a different advertising type.
