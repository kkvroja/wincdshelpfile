<p align="justify">The Credit Sales report shows all sales sent to an outside 
finance company.&nbsp;&nbsp; Theses are also part of your Receivables but are 
separated from the Back Order Receivables as the money is coming from different 
sources.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">This report is perpetual so the date is just the date you 
want to read on the report.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on how you want to sort the report 
by Name or by Sale number.&nbsp; Sale number is preferred.&nbsp; You can also 
select If you want the report separate by sales person, by ageing, or by sale 
date.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">Finally, choose either <i><b>Print</b></i> or <b><i>Print Preview</i></b>. Print will print the report on the default printer, Print Preview will show the report on screen. For help with the Print Preview function, see the <a href="../../Getting Started/Print Preview.htm">Print Preview</a> help page.&nbsp; </p>
