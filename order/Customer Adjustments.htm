<h1>Customer Adjustments</h1>
 With Custom Design Software, you can add to or delete items from an open sales order,  Add or Delete Delivery charges Etc.  
 To make adjustments to part of an open sale (not delivered), click <b>Adjustments</b> under the Order Entry Menu.
Enter the Bill of Sale number. 
<h3>The Customer Adjustment Screen</h3>
The original sale appears on the upper grid as shown below.  The customer wants to return one item 
and take another.  First, Click the left edge of the top grid on the line item you want to return.  
Notice this highlights the line in blue. 
Click on the <b>Return</b> Button at the bottom of the form.  
This brings the returned item onto the lower grid.  
The Quantity and price differrences are negative.

<h3>Adding an Item</h3>
Now the customer wants to add an item.  
To add an item, choose <b>Add</b>, then enter the style number.
Click <b>Ok</b> and the new item is added to the lower grid.  
<br><br>
TIP: Keep in mind the status defaults to ST (Stock).
If you want to Special Order the item, you need to change the ST to SO.  
Also, the quantity defaults to 1.  
If a larger quantity is purchased, then you must change the quantity manually.  
As you Tab off the quantity field, the price will automatically recalculate.  
If the item is a Special Special (catalogue sale), the code to enter would be SS (for "Special Special").  
For an SS sale, you need to enter manually the complete description and vendor name.  
Just like a regular sale, a Purchase Order is created on the new item and the inventory is added back for the old item.

<h3>Price Differences</h3>
Notice on the example, the Difference column shows $70.50, the difference between the return and add on item.  
The new sales tax is charged on just the difference between the two items.   
To add delivery charges for example, click <b>Add</b> button, and enter DEL in the style number box.  
Anytime you make a change, the computer will re-calculate the sale amount, and difference in tax as you tab off the fields.

<h3>Finishing The Adjustments</h3>
When finished with the changes, choose <b>Apply</b> to save changes, or <b>Main Menu</b> to cancel changes and exit. 
You can add items to a sale, delete items from a sale, or any combination of both.
