<h1>Customer Stock Preview</h1>
Often times, you loose sales because you don't have a certain piece in stock.
Use Customer Stock Preview to show the customer the missing piece.
If you keep a computer on the sales floor, this is where employees can look up merchandise, and also verify that they are selling the right piece.

<br/><br/>
<h3>Viewing Stock</h3>
Click <b>Customer Stock Preview</b> from the <i>Order Entry</i> menu.
Enter the Style number in the box for it and tab off. 
If there is a picture available for this piece, it will appear on the screen.  
Alternatively, you can click <i>Select Item By Style</i> to bring up a form to help you find the style number you wish to find.  
This will bring up the standard select style box for you to either enter a partial style, select from a vendor list, or browse by descriptions.

<font color=green size=-2>TIP: The screen can be resized for better view of the image.  Note, however, if you use a low-quality digital image, it may appear grainy as it is stretched past its original dimensions.</font>
<br/><br/>
<font color=blue size=-1>TIP: Use a digital camera, not a scanner, to capture the pictures, because you capture only the specific piece using a digital camera instead of the group image. (The factory photos usually include all related pieces in the group)</font>
<br/><br/>
<h3>Printing the Piece</h3>
You can click the print button to print the image with pricing information.  You can use this as a quote for the customer.
<br/><br/>
<h3>Displaying Inventory</h3>
There is also a blank button above <i>Select Item By Style</i>.  Clicking this button will show you the inventory available at all locations, and total inventory available for sale. If you click this button again, this data will disappear.
<br/><br/>
<h3>Returning to the Main Menu</h3>
To return to the <i>Main Menu</i>, click <b>Close</b>.
