<h3>Selecting the sale to be Delivered</h3>
<table border=0><tr>
<td valign=top>
After a customer's order has been physically delivered or 
picked up, go to <u>Order Entry</u> | <u>Delivery Sales</u> (Ctrl-D). You 
must complete this section because the merchandise has to be removed from the 
Inventory database. To proceed, click on <b>Deliver Sale</b> and enter the Bill of Sale number, then press Enter.
</td>
<td valign=top><img src='Del1.bmp' float=right /></td>
</tr></table>
<br/><br/>
<h3>Delivering the Line Items</h3>
<table border=0><tr>
<td valign=top>
The <i>Deliver Sale</i> form will appear. If you have to <u>Back Date</u> the date 
to the day of delivery, use the drop down calendar. For each item on that sale, choose either 
<b>Deliver</b> or <b>Skip</b>. If the truck brings back an item from the delivery, then it is not delivered so 
you click the <b>Skip</b> button instead of the <b>Deliver</b> button. 
<br/><br/><font size=-2 color=brown style='text-transform:uppercase'>
Be sure to delivery everything on the page including the payments and subtotals 
etc. This will make it easier to spot a Back Ordered Item later.</font></td>
<td valign=top><img src='Del2.bmp' /></td>
</tr></table>
<br/><br/><br/>
<h3>Entering Final Payments (with receipts/email available)</h3>
Because you're in the delivery section, the software proceeds to the payment form automatically. 
Enter the payment amount and type (listed in the How Pd. Dropdown Box), then click <b>OK</b>.<br/><br/>

<font size=-1 color=lightcyan>
<ul>
 <li>Options:<br/>
  <ul>
   <li>Checking <b>Receipt</b> will print out a receipt to mail back to the customer.</li>
   <li>Checking <b>Email</b> will email a copy of the new Bill of Sale to the customer's email address on file.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

</font>
<font size=-1 color=yellow><b>Tip:</b> Use <b>Memo</b> for check or credit card information, or any other pertinent information.</font>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<h3>Partial Payment on Delivery</h3>
Often, the customer does not pay the full balance, but leaves a partial 
balance. Say an item was damaged and they want to withhold $50.00 or so.
When a partial payment is made in delivery section, the software automatically 
displays the following message: <br/>
<br/>
<div style='margin-left:50'><font color=blue size=-2>
Cannot Finish -- Balance Still Due<br/>
There is still a balance due.  Please enter the payment amount or change the payment type to Back Order, Outside<br/>
Finance Company, or Store Finance.</font></div>	
<br/>
When you click <b>OK</b>, the payment amount is cleared. 
Select <b>Backorder</b>, <b>Outside Finance Company</b>, or <b>Store Finance</b>
in the <i>How Pd</i>. dropdown box, then click <b>OK</b> (or press Enter).<br/>
The software then allows you to finish delivering the sale but sets up the remaining balance due as a receivable.
<br/><br/>

<h3>In Store Financing</h3>
If your store does in-store financing, and you're setting this up as a financed 
contract for the balance due, select 
<b>Store Finance</b> in the How Pd. dropdown box. When you click OK, the software will
immediately jump in to the installment setup module.  
<font color=white size=-2>See <a href="../Installment/Index.htm">Financing Module</a> for help.</font>
<br/><br/>

<h3>Outside Finance Company</h3>
Select <b>Outside Finance Company</b> if the contract was sold to an outside financing agency.<br/>
If the contract was sold to an outside finance company, when you receive payment, 
go to <i>Customer Payments</i> and pay off the bill in full regardless if the 
outside finance company charged a fee.<br/>
If a fee was incurred with the finance company, enter the fee under 
<i>Order Entry</i> | <i><a href="Cash Drawer Entries.htm">Cash Drawer Entries</a></i>

<br/><br/>

<h3>Creating a Backorder Sale</h3>
<b>Backorder</b> means there is still a partial balance due.<br/>
To create a backordered sale, simply select the <b>Back Order</b> option from the list and click <b>OK</b>.
This will change the status of the sale to Back Order and finish the delivery process.
<br/><br/>
If an item was backordered, and there is a small balance due on it, when the transaction is complete, 
go back to Deliver Sale. 
Deliver the piece that was delivered, and pay off the balance due when the <i>Payment</i> form appears.
