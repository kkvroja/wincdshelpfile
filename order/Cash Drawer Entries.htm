 Custom Design Software completely controls your bookkeeping and all journals.  
The Cash Drawer option under Order Entry is where you make your bank deposits 
and also controls you petty cash entries. 

<h3>Making An Entry</h3>
 To make a Cash Drawer Entry, click <b>Cash Drawer Entries</b> on the <i>Order Menu</i>.
Money comes into the cash drawer through Customer Deposits.  
This is entered automatically as you make payments. 
Very little else comes into the cash drawer.

 Click the <i>Cash In</i> or <i>Cash Out</i> dropdown box, select the appropriate item (the account number is automatically filled-in when you choose an item), enter the amount, set the date, and click <b>Post</b> (or press Enter).

 <br><br>
<h3>Other Money</h3>
For other money coming in, click<b> Cash In</b>, for example: 
<ul>
	<li><i>Medical Co-Pay</i> if an employee pays for his/her medical co-pay with cash, instead of as a payroll deduction.</li>
	<li><i>Finance Co. Rebate</i> if your finance company gives you a rebate.</li>
	<li><i>Misc. Cash</i> for any other transactions.</li>
</ul>


 Example of <b>Cash Out</b>:
<ul>
	<li><i>Gas &amp; Oil</i> to pay for gas for the store's delivery truck.</li>
	<li><i>Meals &amp; Entertainment</i> to pay for lunch for the store.</li>
	<li><i>Banking Deposits</i> must be entered for the day. </li>
</ul>

<font color=green><b>Note: </b>When the Banking Module is setup, there is an option under <b>Store Set Up </b>which when set, will automatically post the bank deposits into the <b>Banking Module</b>. </font>
<br><br>

<h3>Petty Cash Journal</h3>
 The petty cash journal is included as a section of the <b>Daily Audit Report.</b> 
 If there are any more entries to post in the Cash Drawer, click <b>Next</b> or click <b>Cancel</b>.
