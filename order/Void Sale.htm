<h1 style="color:blue;">Void Sale</h1>
The Void sale in F1 explains that if a customer wants to return an order, use Void to cancel the sale.<br>
 In actual, we can void a sale only if the customer wants to return an entire order or we can void the sale if we want to close the entire sale.<br>
So, if the help centre clearly states that if the customer wants to return the entire order that’s when we void the sale, that would be more clear and understandable.<br>
To void a sale that has been written, click <b>Void Sale</b> on the <i>Order Menu</i>.

<h3>Selecting a Sale</h3>
Enter the Bill of Sale number, then press Enter. 
The following Void form will show on top of the Bill of Sale.  
<br><br>

<br><br>
 
<font color=blue><b>Note:</b> The date is especially important at the end of the month. Be sure the void is posted in the correct month.</font>
<br><br>
You should always use the default date, unless you are voiding a sale that took place before you balanced at the end of last month. 

<h3>Void Options</h3>
 You have several options on the Void Screen.   
<ul>
	<li>Void the sale and return the money as paid.</li>
	<li>Some times, the customer paid by cash and you have to write a company check.</li>
	<li>You want to issue a Store Credit.</li>
	<li>You are keeping the deposit and writing off the sale.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
In either case, click on the option for this sale.  
<h4>Company Check</h4>
If you choose Company Check of Store Credit, you will be able to do all or partial refund or credit.   
<h4>Store Credit</h4>
If you choose Store Credit, the software will print out a Store Credit Memo for the customer.  
It will generate the Bill Of Sale number with an SC added for Store Credit to the number.   
<br><br>
<font color=red><b>Note:</b>  Once a store credit has been issued to the customer, it can be applied to any sale in the future.  To use all the Store Credit, simply 
Void out the <b>Store Credit</b> and apply the full amount of the Store Credit 
to the new sale under <b>Customer Payment.  </b>If you only want to use 
part of the Store Credit and leave a balance remaining, bring the sale up under
<b>Customer Payment,  </b>Make a <b>MINUS</b> payment (-XXX.00)  for 
the amount of money you want to use on the Store Credit.   
</font>

<h4>Forfeit Deposit</h4>
If you choose Forfeit Deposit, you need a password to proceed.  
If the password is accepted, then the sale is Voided, the money is forfeited to income and the sale is locked.  

<h3>After Voiding</h3>
After you click on the <b>Ok</b> button, the Void Sale is processed.  
<ul>
<li>Any inventory is returned to stock and any Special Ordered items, the Purchase Orders are automatically Voided.
<li>If there are any &quot;Special Specials&quot; that have been received, you will be prompted to add these items into the inventory under <a href="../Inventory/New Items.htm">New Items</a>.
</ul>

<font color=blue>TIP: If only some of the items need to be cancelled (instead of the whole order), use <a href="Customer Adjustments.htm">Customer Adjustments</a> to add/remove individual items, delivery charges, etc. for that sale. </font>
