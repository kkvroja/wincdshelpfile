<h1>Departmentalizing the Inventory</h1>
<p align="justify">The first task for setting up the Inventory Module is to generate, on paper, a complete alphabetical list of your vendors. When you are satisfied with your list, you will need to assign each vendor a numeric 3-digit code. The range of the vendor codes is between 005 and 995. Start the first vendor with number 010. Increment the remaining vendors so they spread out evenly between 010 and 990. This will allow for future vendors to fill in the gap between existing vendors, and still remain alphabetical.</p>
<p align="justify">You do not need to type this list anywhere, but keep it handy as you enter each item into the Inventory Database.</p>
<p align="justify">As you begin to enter the inventory into the computer, add the department number to the beginning of the 3 digits vendor number you already have, creating a 4 digit number. The first digit represents the department, ranging from 0 to 9. This allows for a total of 10 departments, and 999 vendors.</p>
<p align="justify">When you purchased the software, a list of vendors was submitted to Custom Design Software for hard-coding into the software.</p>
