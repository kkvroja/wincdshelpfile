This form allows you to route selected deliveries.  The route map displayed, with the directions listed above
and the stops listed to the left.<br><br>
You can either split up the loads at the point, or go on to printing the route.

<h3>Printing the Route</h3>
To print the route, first select the type of printout you want from Microsoft MapPoint.  The options are:
<br><br>
<table width=400 bgcolor=white align=center>
<tr bgcolor=lightblue><td>Option</td><td>Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>Strips</td><td>This option will print a small strip map, followed by driving directions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Full</td><td>This will print a full-paged map for increased detail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Turns</td><td>This will print a small map for every important turn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dirs</td><td>This will print out driving directions only, with no map.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Map</td><td>This prints out an alternative map.</td></tr>
<tr><td>CSV</td><td>This will put write a file to your computer with the route in a format readable by programs such as Microsoft Excel.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
Once you have selected the map type, click <b>Print</b>.  You can print multiple map types.  
Simply select the next type and click <b>Print</b> again

<h3>Splitting the deliveries</h3>
To split the delivery loads between multiple trucks, click <b>Split Loads</b>.<br>
You now will see a list of all the current stops, plus which deliveries are on this truck.  <br>
<img src='Split Loads.bmp'><br>
By default, all deliveries are on the first truck.  To remove or add all the stops to the current truck,
click the <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> buttons, respectively.<br>  To add or remove an
individual stop, simply put the mouse over it, press and hold your left mouse button, and drag it to
the other box (Called Dragging and dropping).  Simply Drag and Drop all the stops until your truck
is loaded or unloaded to your desires.<br>
<br>
To help you decide which stops should go on which truck, there are two things to help you.  First, you can
click on <b>Details</b> and more information will be displayed for each stop.  Click this again to return to
the default view.<br>

You can also click on <b>Show Stops</b> to show a map below the lists to see where they are, without
calculating a route between them.  Click this button again to hide them.<br>

<h4>Routing the current truck</h4>
To route the truck that you have set up under <b>Split Loads</b>, simply click the <b>Route Stops</b> button.
This will route the stops in the current truck.  If this is acceptable, you can click <b>Print</b> to
print the route for these stops.  When you return to the <b>Split Loads</b>, the stops you have already
routed will be slightly transparent to indicate that they have already been routed.  Repeat this until
all the stops have been routed.

<h3>Configure Optimization</h3>

<table bgcolor=white border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=1>
<tr bgcolor=lightblue><td>Field</td><td>Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>Start Time</td><td>This sets the time that Microsfot MapPoint&copy; will scheduled your truck to depart at.  The default is 7:00am</td></tr>
<tr><td>Time Per Stop</td><td>This sets how long the truck is allotted at each stop once it arrives.  The default is 10 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cost Per Mile</td><td>Adjusting this will change how the route is optimized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cost Per Mile</td><td>Adjusting this will change how the route is optimized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Trucks</td><td>Currently can only be 1</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Adjust Route</h3>
Once WinCDS has worked to find the best route, you can view the route on screen, including Time Windows, Arrival/Departure Times, and more.  From this screen, you can view the route, or rearrange it selecting a stop and using the up/down arrows on the right.  You can also have WinCDS try to work a while longer to find an optimal solution by clicking the <b>Continue</b> button.  If you are satisfied with the route, you can click <b>Close</b>.
