<h3>Viewing Deliveries</h3>
You will see deliveries for <u>today and the next 31 days</u> listed in the grid. 
Click <b>Print</b> to print this list, or <b>Menu</b> to return to the main menu.

<h3>P or D Designation</h3>
You will see either a <b>P</b> or a <b>D</b> next to the style number. 
The <b>P</b> indicates the item is scheduled for Pick-UP, the <b>D</b>  is for Delivery. 

<h3>Setting up Delivery Dates</h3>
Before you can use this section, the customer's delivery dates must be setup.
This is done either at the Point of Sale or after the sale is written, in <a href="../Check Order Status.htm">Check Order Status</a>.
Use this when Lay-A-Ways, Special Orders, Special-Specials, or Tag Incoming Stock orders have been received and need to be delivered. 

<h3>Delivery Zone</h3>
You can also "Zone" the days to put a column heading on the days deliveries to help prevent your delivery truck from criss-crossing town.
To put in a column heading, highlight the column as in the example below, Enter the delivery Zone or City in the box Provided, and click <b>Apply</b> to save.

<h3>Route and Map Printing (via MS MapPoint integration)</h3> 
Custom Design Software has the ability to automatically print a route sheet for the drivers complete with instructions 
from the store to the 
homes in the best possible order.
A map is also supplied. 
<br><br>
This option requires <a href='\Support\MMP.htm'>Microsoft Map Point</a>, available for purchase from Microsoft.  

<br/><br/> 
When there are deliveries for a day, highlight the column as below. 
When available, the <b>Map</b> button will be enabled.  
Click <b><a href='Delivery Map.htm'>Map</a></b> to generate the map and route.
