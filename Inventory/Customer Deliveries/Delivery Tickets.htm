The <u>Delivery Tickets</u> form will appear.<br/><br/>
<img src="DeliveryTickets.bmp" align=right />

<h3>Delivery Tickets</h3>
The software will print out a delivery ticket for each sale.
It shows most of the same information as the original Bill of Sale, except it shows only the pieces that have <u>not</u> been delivered.
<br/><br/>

<font color=green><b>Tip:</b> After the first items are delivered, the next time pieces come in, the Delivery Ticket turns into a backorder slip, because only the remaining pieces are listed.</font>
<br/><br/>

<h3>Printing Tickets</h3>
Normally, up to four copies are printed when the sale is created. 
One of these copies is usually marked as a delivery copy. 
However, if you prefer to have the computer generate delivery tickets previous to making the delivery, go to Delivery Tickets form, choose the date, and click <b>Print</b>. 
All orders to be delivered that day will be printed. Delivery Tickets can be reprinted as often as necessary by using the <b>Reprint All</b> option.
<br/><br/>

<h3>Printing for an Individual Sale</h3>
You can also print a delivery ticket for an individual sale by using the <b>Sale:</b> option.<br/><br/>

<h3>Setting up Delivery Dates</h3>
Before you can use this section, the customer's delivery dates must be setup, either at the Point of Sale or after the sale is written, in <a href="../Check Order Status.htm">Check Order Status</a>. 
Use this when Lay-A-Ways, Special Orders, Special-Specials, or Tag Incoming Stock orders have been received and need to be set up for delivery.
