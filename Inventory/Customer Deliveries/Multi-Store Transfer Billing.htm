When you do a store transfer for stock merchandise in a Multi-Store chain, you have to be able to 
bill the stores for the merchandise shipped to them for <b>Stock</b>. <br/><br/>

The software starts at location 1 and prints bills out to stores 2, 3, 4, etc. 
Then it starts at store 2 and bills to stores 1, 3, 4 etc. in case there was stock 
merchandise moved from other locations.<br/><br/>

Simply set the date range and click <b>Print</b>. You can select all stores or each store individually in the drop down.
