To pay commissions or edit Sales Staff for a sale, click <b>Commissions</b> from the <i>Inventory</i> Menu.

<h3>Setting up Commissions</h3>
The Commisions must first be set up within the <a href="../File/Store%20Setup/Commissions/Index.htm">Store Setup Commissions Section</a>.
From there, you will be able to select payment on Delivered, Written, and select from various 
commissions formulas.  Additionally, customization options are available by contating
Custom Design Software.
<br/><br/>
<font size='+1' color='white'><b><u>IMPORTANT:</u>  </b>Please be sure to set up your commissions in the <i>Store Setup</i> before 
running Commissions for the first time.  You can contact WinCDS for more details on this one-time setup.</font>
<h3>Running Commissions On Your Database</h3>
The Commissions process consists of two steps.
<ol>
<li>First, the comissions reports are generated and either printed to the screen or the printer.  <b>At this point, nothing has changed in the database.</b></li>
<li>Second, you can choose to post the Commissions to the database.  This actually marks the sales commissions as paid based on the reports generated.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Step 1 - Generating Commissions Reports</h4>
To generate the report, select the options from the top of the form.
<br>
<ul>
<li>To preview the report, instead of printing it, select the <b>Preview</b> checkbox.</li>
<li>If you want to view individual sale sub-totals, select the <b>Show Sale Sub totals</b> checkbox.</li>
</ul>
Once you have selected the generating options you want, click the <b>Recalc</b> button.
<br/><br/>
You have now generated your report (either on screen or printed), but have not posted the changes to your database.

<h4>Step 2 - Post Commissions</h4>
When you have simply run the reports, the form will display <font color='blue'>NOT POSTED</font> 
to indicate that the commissions have been run but not posted to the database.
<br/><br/>
After you have reviewed the reports, made any and all Sales Staff adjustments and run the reports again, and are satisfied, click <b>Post</b> to make the changes
permanent.

<h3>Additional Operations</h3>
In addition to simply running Commissions, you also have several operations you can perform on your data
that will affect your commissions.
<h4>Edit Salesperson</h4>

If you need to adjust the salesperson on a sale, check the <b>Edit Salesperson</b> checkbox.<br>
Enter the sale number you wish to adjust and select the sales person and the sales percentages for the sale.
You will need to re-run the commissions report before posting after you do this.

<h4>Edit Spiff</h4>

If you need to adjust the spiff on an item, check the <b>Edit Spiff</b> checkbox.<br>
Enter the sale number you wish to adjust, go to the line-item you wish to change the spiff on and simply change it.
You will need to re-run the commissions report before posting after you do this.

<h4>Commissions Confirmation</h4>

This feature allows you to verify the Commissions

<h4>Reprinting Comissions Reports</h4>

To reprint a prior period already posted, check the <b>Reprint Report</b> checkbox.
Select the date the desired report was run from the drop-down list and run the report.
The selected report should print to the printer or screen, depending on the option you selected.
<br/><br/>
Additionally, the <b>PDF</b> button allows you access to the Report PDF archive.  If enabled, every time you
run the Commissions report, a PDF version of the report will be generated for a perpetual archive.
<br/><br/>
You can either view the archived report, or generate a new commissions summary for the date based on the database
tracking.
