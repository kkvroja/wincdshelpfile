multiple manufacturers, click <i><b>Inventory</b></i>: <i><b>Reports</b></i>: <i>
<b>Package Ticket Builder</b></i>.&nbsp; A Package Builder form will appear.&nbsp; 
Start in the upper left corner and select the manufacturer in the drop down.&nbsp; 
All the items this manufacture has in the database will appear on the screen.&nbsp; 
Find the items you want on a package tag and check the check box for each item.&nbsp; 
Each item will appear in the list below.&nbsp; If you have to change the 
quantity, click into the quantity column and change the quantity.&nbsp; Be sure 
to <i><b>Tab</b></i> off the quantity column as that sets the recalculations of 
the prices.&nbsp; As you are building the items for the package, the prices are 
recalculating on the screen.&nbsp; They exactly add up the same prices that 
would be on the individual price tags.&nbsp; Also, the Gross Margin on the 
package is show.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Note:</b> You can also select another manufacturer for the 
drop down to make complete packages from different manufacturers.</p>
<p align="justify">If you want to give a Special Price for buying the package, 
either change the Gross Margin figure and Tab off it to recalculate or change 
the On Sale Price to you desired Package Price.&nbsp; The Gross Margin, will 
recalculate accordingly.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">The next step would be to make the Ticket Heading as 
indicated.&nbsp; A heading like 7 Pc Bedroom Set for example.&nbsp; In the next 
field Kit number, you enter the style number for the kit.&nbsp; It can be 
alphanumeric like 1000 or Serenity Set.&nbsp; The software automatically add the
<b>Kit-</b> in from of the style number.&nbsp; To access the kit on a sale you 
would enter KIT-1000 or KIT-Serenity Set.&nbsp; Finally, the Notes on Tickets is 
your description of what's included in the kit.&nbsp; You can enter, for 
example, Dresser, Mirror Chest &amp; Bed.&nbsp; The individual style numbers do <b>
not</b> show up on the price tags.&nbsp; So, if you need them them on the tag, 
you can Cut and Past them onto the Notes.&nbsp; You can enter:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dresser 2074-237<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2074-251</p>
<p align="justify">The only thing left to do is decide which prices besides the 
package price do you want printed on the tags.&nbsp; You can choose to use the
<b>List Price</b> or the <b>On Sale</b> price as the Regular Price or, use <b>No 
List Price</b> at all.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">Finally, click <i><b>Save</b></i> and then <i><b>Print</b></i> 
the tags.&nbsp; If you want to make more tags, click <i><b>Next</b></i> or <i>
<b>Menu</b></i> to quit.&nbsp; The <i><b>Clear</b></i> button will clear the tag 
incase you want to start over.&nbsp; Use <i><b>Delete</b></i> to delete the kit 
completely.&nbsp; </p>
