<h1 style = "color:red">Orders Not Acknowledged</h1>
To print a list of any SOs that have not been acknowledged by the manufacturer, click <i><b>Inventory</b></i>: <b><i> Orders Not Acknowledged</i></b>. The &quot;Not Acknowledged Since:&quot; form will appear. Choose the starting date to print any orders that have not been acknowledged by the manufacturer.<br>
<br>
Example: If you want to print a list of all SOs sent out in the last 10 days, but not acknowledged by the manufacturer 
(via entering the acknowledgement number on the View/Edit PO screen), set the starting date back 10 days, and print the report.<br>
<br>
<b>Tip:</b> Use this report to see if any SOs have been lost or not received by the manufacturer between the starting date and today's date.</p>
<p align="justify">Choose either <i><b>Print</b></i> or <b><i>Print Preview</i></b>. Print (default) will print the report on the default printer, Print Preview will show the report on screen. For help with the Print Preview function, see the <a href="../../Getting Started/Print Preview.htm">Print Preview</a> help page.</p>
