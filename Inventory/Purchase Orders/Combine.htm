<h3>Combining POs</h3>
The feature allows you to combine multiple POs under separate PO Numbers into a single PO.  This
solves the problem of keeping and tracking multiple items from the same vendor from the same vendor,
and allows you to consolidate them into a single tracking number for convenience and ease of reference
both within your organization as well as with the manufacturers.
<br/><br/>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
To begin with, the Purchase Orders (POs) you want to combine must satisfy these conditions.
<ol>
<li>They must be from the same vendor.</li>
<li>They must not already be fully received.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Combine Qualified POs</h3>
Having satisfied the conditions, you are ready to combine your POs.
<br><br>
To combine open Purchase Orders, open the Combine POs and wait until the <i>Compiling PO Information</i> 
progress bar completes.  This is generating all of the PO information for all of your vendors so you
can select which POs you wish to combine.  The process usually compleets in under a minute.
<br/><br/>
Next, select the vendors you wish to combine from the box using the check-boxes.  This will combine all open
POs for these vendors with the POs of like vendors.  For instance, If you select COASTER and HARDEN in the
image above, all of the COASTER POs will be combined into one PO, and all of the HARDEN POs will be combined into
another.
<br/><br/>
Once you have selected them, click <b>Combine</b>.  The new results will be displayed when the process is complete.
<br/><br/>
<h3>Options</h3>
<ul><li><b>Since</b> Date Box</li>
<ul>
<li>Additionally, you can specify a cut-off-date for the POs.  If you only wish to generate the POs since a certain date,
Check the box in the date box, change the date to your cut-off Epoch, and click <b>Refresh</b>.  You will need
to wait again for the <i>Compiling PO Information</i> progress bar to complete.  When finished, simply select the
PO Vendors, and click <b>Combine</b> as you would normally.
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Exiting</h3>
When finished, simply click <b>Menu</b> to exit the form.
