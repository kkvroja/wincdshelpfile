<h1>Recieve Shipments</h1>

<p align="justify">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">All Special Orders 
for customers and Stock Orders, which are entered via the computer, must be 
received in the Purchase Order Module.&nbsp; </span>To receive a Purchase Order, click <i><b>Inventory</b></i>: <b><i>Purchase Orders</i></b>: <b><i>Receive Shipments</i></b>. If you know the PO Number 
or Bill Of Sale Number, enter it in the box, and press Enter. Otherwise, click Lookup, find the PO in the list, and double-click it. The Purchase Order screen appears.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">If you have not entered the Invoice on Acknowledgement 
number, do it now!&nbsp; (If you don't have the Invoice, or acknowledgement 
number, this number can be located on the Freight Bill.) Check the cost and edit 
it if necessary if you hadn't checked the cost when you got the acknowledgement.&nbsp; 
The new cost automatically goes back into the sales order, and updates the Cost 
Of Goods Sold if the item is a Special Order.&nbsp; In a stock shipment, if the 
cost is changed, the new cost goes back into the inventory database and updates 
the factory cost of the item.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Tip:</b> After you have clicked the <b><i>Rec. All</i></b> 
button, enter the invoice number in the first line item.&nbsp; Click <b><i>Rec. 
All</i></b> again and the software will automatically populate the invoice 
number on all line items.&nbsp; This saves many key strokes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="Rec%20PO.bmp"></p>
<p align="justify">Next, the apply button will be activated.&nbsp; Click the 
Apply button and the following form will appear on the screen. This form 
actually does the receiving.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="Rec%20PO%20form%202.bmp"></p>
<p align="justify">The form shows the quantity ordered as 3.&nbsp; Quantity 
Received in blue can be changed if the factory Back Orders some items.&nbsp; 
Depending on how you pay your bills, whether upon &quot;Receipt Of Goods or Actual 
Invoice Date&quot;&nbsp; Set the date to reflect the dating you want in A/P. For 
stock shipments as this, you have several options indicated by the bullet.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">Select Each Floor Tag allows you to individually receive 
	each items and individually pick which items you want to print a retail 
	price tag for.&nbsp; </p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">Print all w/Floor tags, will print out retail price tags 
	for all items on the Purchase Order.&nbsp; The check box will activate so 
	you can process the entire order with one click.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">Print NO Floor Tags avoids the prince tag form.&nbsp; The 
	check box will activate so you can process the entire order with one click.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><b>Note:</b> I do <b>NOT</b> recommend receiving the entire 
order by checking the check box.&nbsp; This will definitely lead to missing back 
ordered items!</p>
<p align="justify">If you need to skip an item entirely, use the Skip button.&nbsp; 
Stop receiving will stop any more processing of this Purchase Order.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">When you have completed the Purchase Order, a form comes up 
requesting any &quot;Prepaid Freight&quot;.&nbsp; Because we have completely integrated 
Accounts Payable, any Prepaid Freight by the factory must be accounted for so 
the software can distribute the invoice.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">If you don't have the Invoice yet, the date of the freight 
bill will be the date of shipment on the invoice.&nbsp; It's always the same.&nbsp; 
We need this date to set up the dating on the Accounts Payable side.&nbsp; It 
later can be edited in the Accounts Payable module.</p>
<p align="justify">Click OK when done or leave blank if no prepaid freight is 
charged.&nbsp; Message box comes up; Po Has Been Received!&nbsp; Click OK .&nbsp; 
You are asked if there are any more PO's to receive.&nbsp; If not, you are 
returned to the Main Menu.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">Here's what receiving the PO's will do:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">For stock shipments, you have the option of printing out 
	new Price Tags for the Floor.&nbsp; If the cost has changed, then Inventory 
	cost in the data base will be upgraded and the On Sale and Factory List 
	Prices will automatically be recalculated based on your setting in the data 
	base.&nbsp; You then can print out new retail price tags for the floor.&nbsp; 
	If there are any sold orders tagged against incoming stock, these orders 
	will be received and the balance, if any, will be added to the data base.&nbsp; 
	These orders will be marked POREC on the sales order.&nbsp; </p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">For Special Ordered Shipments,<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"> 
	the computer tags the items as </span>
	<span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&quot;SOREC&quot; </span>
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">or &quot;SSREC&quot; 
	accordingly. If you view the sale, the status column will show the change on 
	each item. The computer will now recognize that the item has been received.&nbsp; 
	The cost Of Goods Sold gets automatically updated. </span></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">On both Special Order and Stock shipments, if you have 
	set the store set up to print receiving labels, then a Bar Coded 2 1/4 x 4&quot;&nbsp; 
	labels on the Dymo Label Printer.&nbsp; The case amount of the purchase 
	order will be entered automatically into A/P if you have this option set.&nbsp; 
	Both Stock and Special Ordered Purchase Orders will be available on the 
	Receiving Reports in the Purchase Order Module.&nbsp; </p></li>
</ul>
