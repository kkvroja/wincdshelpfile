<p align="justify">Custom Design Software offers 4 separate methods of ordering stock &quot;Fill In&quot; 
merchandise.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><i><b><font size="4">Manually Entered Stock Purchase Orders</font></b></i></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">To create a purchase order, click <i><b>Inventory</b></i>: <i><b>Purchase Orders</b></i>: 
	<b><i>Order for Stock</i></b>. The next form that appear on the screen will 
	allow you to choose how you want to review the Inventory data base. If you want to scan through every item, choose
	<b><i>Every Item</i></b>. If you want to scan only by manufacturer, choose 
	<b><i>By Manufacturer</i></b>, and select the manufacturer in the drop down 
	list. If you want to scan only by department, choose <b><i>By Department</i></b>, and enter 
	select the department number in the drop down list. In any of the 3 choices, Click OK (or press Enter) to continue.</p>
	<p align="justify">Next, the &quot;Order for Stock&quot; and &quot;Purchase Orders&quot; forms appear. In the purchase order form, use the back/forward buttons to scroll through the database to find the item you wish to order. When found, enter the quantity you wish to order, 
	and the store location you want the merchandise shipped to.&nbsp; click <b>
	<i>Apply</i></b> to save this line item.&nbsp; As long as you stay within 
	one manufacturer, a single purchase order will be generated.&nbsp; 
	<p align="justify">When finished, click <b><i>Cancel</i></b> and <b><i>Menu</i></b> to return to the main menu.</p>
	<p align="justify"><b><i>Note: </i></b>Purchase Orders are the only thing that Custom Design 
	Software Batches.&nbsp; In other words, a P/O is not printed at this time.&nbsp; 
	At the end of the day or whenever you choose, you click on Inventory, 
	Purchase Orders, Quick Print POs to actually print out the purchase orders.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4"><b><i>Minimum Level Stock</i></b></font><i><b><font size="4"> 
Purchase Orders </font></b></i></p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">This method of ordering &quot;Fill In&quot; stock merchandise is based on setting 
	minimum stock levels for your &quot;Best Sellers&quot;.&nbsp; The minimum stock level 
	is set on the Main Inventory Screen.&nbsp; For multiple stores, this field 
	represents the minimum stock level at <b>each</b> store.&nbsp; </p>
	<p align="justify">When you click on this option, a form is generated on the screen showing. 
	by default, anything the is less than the minimum stock level set for each 
	item.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">You select an individual store, individual manufacturer or department to 
	limit the selection.&nbsp; On this form, you can double click on the Tag/Untag 
	column to stop the ordering of that line item.&nbsp; You can also change the 
	Ordering column if you want to increase or decrease the quantities.&nbsp; 
	When you ready, click on Order button and the Purchase Order will be built 
	as per form.&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; <font size="4"><b><i>Order By Demand </i></b></font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">The Order By Demand function was designed to help you 
	order merchandise just in time to deliver to customers. You may find this 
	function especially helpful if your store sells items on Layaway and waits 
	to order them until a certain amount has been collected, or while out of 
	stock, intending to make delivery from the next purchase order.<br>
	<br>
	To generate orders by demand, select the Store Number and date range you 
	would like to order for. This will load any PO or LAW sale items scheduled 
	for delivery in that date range into the upper grid. At the same time, the 
	lower grid will be filled with corresponding inventory item descriptions.<br>
	<br>
	This part looks confusing, but don't fear! The lower grid behaves exactly 
	like the Minumum Stock Levels screen. The difference is that the amount to 
	order is taken from the upper grid. You don't need to do anything to the 
	lower grid in order to make orders by demand.<br>
	<br>
	Select the items you wish to order in the upper grid, by double-clicking in 
	the Order column. This will cause an &quot;x&quot; to appear in that cell. At the same 
	time, the lower grid will jump to the matching item definition, put an &quot;x&quot; 
	in the Tag/ Untag column, and adjust the Ordering value.<br>
	<br>
	If you select an item by mistake or change your mind, simply double-click 
	the upper grid's &quot;x&quot; to remove that item from the order.<br>
	<br>
	The Order combo box adjusts the sorting of the upper grid. This can help you 
	verify that you've ordered all of a customer's items, or everything you 
	require from a certain vendor. Changing the sort order does not alter the 
	items you have already scheduled for ordering.<br>
	<br>
	When the lower grid reflects your purchasing desires, click the Order button 
	to create the purchase orders. One purchase order will be made for each 
	selected vendor.<br>

	Inventory, View Stock Items.&nbsp; Enter the item you want to order.&nbsp; 
	There is a PO button on the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; Click on the button, 
	enter quantity and location, the purchase order is automatically entered &quot;On
