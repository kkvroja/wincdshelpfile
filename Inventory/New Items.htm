<h3>Creating a New Inventory Item</h3>
To create a new inventory item, select <b>New Items</b> from the <i>Inventory Menu</i>.  You will be prompted to enter the new <u>Style Number</u>.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<h3>Entering the New Style Number</h3>
Enter a new alpha/numeric style number.
As you start typing the style number, a box will appear to the right with similar existing style numbers.
As you keep typing, this list will narrow down, and eventually be empty.
If this list is not empty, you are trying to add a duplicate style number.
You cannot add a duplicate style number. Choose OK (or press Enter) to continue.<br><br>

<font color=red><b>Tip:</b> Do <u>not</u> enter the fabric type in the style number. Instead, include this in the <i><b>Description</b></i> field. </font>
<br><br>

The Style Number will be automatically transferred to the <i>Inventory Form</i>.

<br><br>
<h3>Setting up the New Item</h3>
Next, click on the drop-down for the Department and select which vendor this item is from.
<br><br>
If this is a new manufacturer, click on the <i>New Manufacturer</i> and type in the manufacturer's name.
You can use a shortened version of the manufacturer's name.
For example, if the company name is Bassett Furniture Company, Bassett is sufficient.  
If you have already used this manufacturer, then the old manufacturer is the default, just find the manufacturer in the drop down list and select it.
<br><br>
The Date will default to the current date.
<h3>Entering the Item Description</h3>
Go to <i>Description</i>.
The <i>Description</i> is the most important field. 
This is what prints on the top line on Price Tags, Bill Of Sale, and Purchase Orders.
<br><br>
<font color=green size='-1'><b>TIP:</b>You can save items on sales with the sizes, color, and finish.  You do not need to enter that here.</font>
<br><br>
Enter in the description anything that you need to reorder this item, other than the style.
An example might be: <b>86" G/O SOFA  R-2651-BLUE</b><br>
<h3>Other Options</h3>
If this item is a top seller, enter a <i>Minimum Stock Level</i> in the <i>M/Stock</i> field to be flagged when the inventory drops below this number.
If left blank, you will not be flagged when stock runs low. 
For multiple stores, this minimum stock level is for <b>each</b> location.
<br><br>
<font color=green><b>Tip:</b> In most cases, leave this blank, unless you want to be flagged. This is usually used only for best-sellers. </font>
<br><br>
Enter <i>Freight Percentage</i> as a number like 10, <i>Gross Markup</i> as a number like 47, <i>List Add</i> as a number like 40, and <i>Cost</i>.
When you tab off <i>Cost</i>, <i>Landed</i>, <i>On Sale</i>, and <i>List</i> will be automatically filled in.
If you wish to change <i>On Sale</i>, it will automatically update the <i>Gross Markup</i> when you tab off the <i>On Sale</i> field. 
<br><br>
For more information click on <a href="../_private/Cost%20Code-Message/Price%20Tag%20Options">Price Tag Options</a>.   
<br><br>
You can then enter an extra note in <i>Comments</i> which will appear on the retail price tags.
Enter the total number of this item Physically On Hand for sale in the <b> <i>Quantity </i></b>box. 
If you have one location, enter the same quantity in the <i>St. Loc1</i>. 
If you have multiple stores, enter the quantity for each store in the respective box. 
The total number you have added will show in <i>Allocation</i>. <i>Allocation</i> must equal <i>Quantity</i>. 
Enter the Invoice Number inside the gray box.
<br><br>
<font color='yellow'><b>Tip:</b> If you are entering starting inventory, use <b>999999</b> (instead of looking up each invoice).</font>
<br><br>

<h3>Printing Tags</h3>
 Click <i><b>Print Tags</b></i> to print retail price tags for display.  
Select the printer you want to print tags on, size of tag to be printed.  
Click <b>Done</b> when completed.   

<h3>Saving the item</h3>
Finally, Click <b>Apply</b> to post the item.   
When you are done, choose <b>OK</b> to enter another piece of merchandise, or <b>Main Menu</b> to return to the front screen.
A "Click on Selection" form will appear. 
<br><br>
If you choose <b>More from this Manufacturer<</b>, most of the data will remain on screen to reduce input time. <br>
If you choose <b>New Manufacturer</b> the data will be erased from the screen, to ease entry of different data. 

<h3>Package Prices</h3>
 You want to make a group price on a tabletop and base. The series is 2200, the top is 2200-20 and the base is 2200-40.
<br>Enter the inventory item as <b>2200-20/40</b>. Add the cost together, and combine the description. 
This method should only be used when you always sell the sets the same way.  
<br><br>
<b>Tip:</b> Be consistent with your numbering convention. 
<br><br>
 You sell a sofa/loveseat combo, but normally list them as separate inventory items, because they can be purchased separately. Create a package price if you can <u>only</u> buy them as a set. 
 We can also create kits which consist of multiple items at a 
special price.
