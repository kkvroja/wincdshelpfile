An &quot;Dog List (Worst Sellers)&quot; form will appear. <br/><br/>

The Dog List shows the worst selling merchandise.<br/><br/>

You can select the amount of items that will be displayed by selecting the percentage.<br/>
In addition, you can sort and select by either Vendor or Department.<br/><br/>

When you run the report, the items that have sold the worst will appear.  This is calculated based on
the number of days since the last stock intake to the most recent sale on that item after the intake.  This
number is reported as N-days and is the default method for sorting the report.
