<h1>Your Software Has Expired</h1>

<img src='KillBug.bmp' />
<br/><br/>
Use of WinCDS requires you to pay support fees in accordance with your <a href='EndUserAgreement.htm'>licensing agreement</a>.<br/><br/>

If you do not pay your support fees in accordance with your contract, your software may enter a
locked state as displayed above which will continue until it is released by Custom Design Software (CDS).<br/><br/>

This is in accordance with the contract that all end users must accept to use this software.<br/><br/>

The only option you have from this notice is to close the program.<br/><br/>

Alternatively, if you have contacted CDS and were told to upgrade your program, you can still
access the Manual Program Update page.  To access this page, press and hold the <i>Control</i>
key on your keyboard.  The background of the form should change color.  While holding <i>Control</i>,
click on Close.  You cannot access any other program features until your software has been
unlocked by CDS.
