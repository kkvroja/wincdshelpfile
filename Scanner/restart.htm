<h1>Inventory Scanner Restart</h1>
		In addition to the menus, there are also a few other features of the wireless scanner.
		If you wish to restart the software of the scanner without a full power-off/power-on cycle,
		simply press <b>0</b> (zero) from the main menu.  This will cause the screen to clear,
		the software to reset, and the startup procedure to begin.
