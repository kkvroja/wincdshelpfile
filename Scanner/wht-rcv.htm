<h1>Receive PO - Warehouse Tracking - Inventory Scanner</h1>

Use this option to receive items on a PO.

<h4>Receive PO</h4>
You will be prompted for the following fields:
<ul>
<li>PONo</li>
<li>Style</li>
<li>Bin</li>
<li>Serial</li>
</ul>
This should be used after you have already recieved the PO through WinCDS.  This process will
print all of your receiving labels which you will then scan, along with the location barcodes.<br/><br/>

PONo must be a valid Purchase Order Number and the curresponding PO must not be void.
Style must be provided and be a valid Style Number.  It must also be found on the PO.
You must also supply a valid Bin (generated by our rack-label printer under the file menu).

Serial Number can be left blank or filled in.  Remember that
the more information you enter, the better tracking you will have later on.
