<h1>Inventory Scanner System Menu</h1>

If it is ever necessary to access the system menu of the CipherLAB scanner, you can do this
by first turning the unit off.  While the unit is off, hold down the 7 and 9 keys while turning
on the unit.  This will bring the unit into the <b>System Menu</b>.
<br><br>
To return to normal operation, power off the unit and turn it back on.
