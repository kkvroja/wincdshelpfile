<h1>Inventory Scanner Function Keys</h1>
From anywhere in the software, you can also use the special <b>Function Keys</b>.  To use
these, press the <i>FN/Alpha</i> key located at the bottom left of the keypad until
you see an <b><u>F</u></b> in the bottom right of the screen above the the batter indicator.
This will indicate that the keypad is in <i></i>Funtion Key<i></i> mode.  
<br>Now, instead of the keys entering characters, each number on the keypad will execute
the following operation:
<br>
<h3>Available Functions</h3>
<ol>
 <li value=1><u>Toggles between <i>Normal</i> and <i>Silent Mode</i></u>.  In silent mode, the scanner
 will not beep at all, neither for confirmation or for errors.  Be sure to watch the status
 screen when entering data.</li>
 <li value=2><u>Starts/Stops the scanner's networking features</u>.  Switching the networking
 features off will provide a longer battery life.  Note that the network will restart automatically
 whenever any feature requiring it is activated.</li>
</ol>
