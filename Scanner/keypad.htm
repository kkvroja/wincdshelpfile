<h1>Inventory Scanner Keypad</h1>
The keypad of the 8061-C Bluetooth scanner allows you to type in both letters, numbers,
and most common symbols.  To save space, these keys are combined onto fewer buttons.
When you first power on the unit, pressing the keys will result in the symbol in 
<font color=white>white</font> being entered.  You can also type in either
captial or small letters, as well as put the keypad into function mode.  To type
the alternate letters/symbols (the ones in <font color=yellow>yellow</font>), press the <i>FN/Alpha</i> key at the bottom right of
the keypad until you see the appropriate symbol in the bottom left of the screen.
<b><u>A</u></b> represents <i>capital letters</i>, <b><u>a</u></b> represents lower-case
letters, <b><u>F</u></b> represents <a href=functions.htm>Function Mode</a>, and
none indicating normal input.
<br><br>
Once you have entered a value, you can press either of the two blue buttons which both act as
<i>Enter</i> keys.
<br><br>
If you would like to scan a value into the scanner instead of entering it into the keypad,
aim the scanner at the barcode you would like to scan and press the large, yellow button at the top
center of the keypad.
<br><br>
If you are on a form with multiple fields, you can generally use the <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> buttons
to select the field you wish to enter into next.
<br><br>
If you are on a menu, you can either use the up and down arrows to select an item and press one
of the <font color=cyan>Blue</font> enter keys or press the number corresponding to that
menu item to automatically select it for ease of use.
<br><br>
At almost any time, you can press the <b>ESC</b> key to exit out of any menu, form, or process.
