<h1 style = "color:red">Physical Inventory - Inventory Scanner</h1>
There are options in the Physical Inventory Menu:
<ul>
<li>Scan</li>
<li>Upload Data</li>
<li>Delete Data</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scan</h3>
To scan an item, first select Scan from the Physical Inventory menu.  Enter the location
where you are performing your inventory (for example, press <b>1</b> on the keypad and press
the Blue Enter key).  Next, scan a barcode and enter the quantity.  Continue scanning and entering
quantities until you are done.  Press <b>ESC</b> when you are done scanning.
<h3>Upload Data</h3>
When you are finished uploading data, you can use the Upload Data option to upload it
to WinCDS.  See the relevant data import section for how to prepare WinCDS to receive the data.
<h3>Delete Recs</h3>
To delete the records without uploading them to WinCDS, select the third option.  To confirm
this operation, you will be prompted to enter <b>123</b> into the field presented and press enter.
Pressing <b>Enter</b> without entering <b>123</b>or <b>ESC</b> will cancel the delete.
