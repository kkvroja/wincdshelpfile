<h3>Report</h3>
<p align="justify">This screen creates reports based on sales data and 
advertising types.&nbsp; These reports deliver customer counts, grouped by zip 
code and city.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<h3>Options</h3>
The first option for these reports is to include all customers, or only those 
who made purchases within a certain time period. To restrict your report to a 
certain period, select Date Range, then enter a Start Date and End Date. 
Otherwise, select All Customers.<br>
<br>
Next, choose whether you would like to see Advertising Types or not.&nbsp; 
Select Advertising Customer Analysis to split the report by advertising type, or 
Customers by Zip Code Analysis to get a list by zip code and city. Note: 
Advertising Customer Analysis excludes customers set to &quot;Get Mail&quot; or &quot;No Mail&quot;.<br>
<br>
<h3>Printing</h3>
Finally, you may choose to run these reports on one store or all stores. Make 
your selection in the dropdown box.<br>
