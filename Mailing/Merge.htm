<h2>Merging Mailing List Addresses</h2>
You have two ways to use the Mail Marge form.
If you already know the customer with the duplicate names, click <b>Next</b> to start and enter the name on the form that appears.
If you prefer to let the software find all the duplicate names, click <b>Find</b>.  
<font size='-2' style='color:green'>Note: this may take hours depending on the number of names in the mailing list.  It will also take
less time if run directly from the server.</font><br/>
<br/>
<font size='-1' style='color:orange'>It is advisable to backup the POS system before running the merge.</font>

<h2>Auto-detection</h2>
WinCDS can automatically look up names similar to one you specify to see if there are duplicate
names in the database.  Click <b>Next</b> and enter a name in the form.  The software will fill
the box with all the similar names it detects in the database.  If some of them do not match,
simply clear the check-box for that line.
<h3>Adding Additional Names</h3>
If you know of another name that is not automatically detected by our software, you can click the
<b>Add</b> button and enter and select it.  It will appear in the box below the other items.  If
you wish to not include it, you can either clear it's check-box or start over using the
<b>Clear</b> button.
<h3>Merging Mail Accounts</h3>
To do a comprehensive, irrevocable merger of mail records, once you have filled in the box and
selected only the mail records you wish to merge, click the <b>Merge</b> button.  You will be
prompted for which record to combine the others into and then asked for one final confirmation
indicating that this change is IRREVOCABLE.
<br/><br/>
The software will then update all of the database for these records, rectifying them all
into one mail account and deleting all record of the others.  This includes Gross Margin,
Service Modules, Installment Modules, and Addresses.  Once done, it will reload the
names from the database and allow you either to click the <b>Menu</b> button to exit the form
or continue with another name.
<h2>Optionally Find All Possible Duplicates</h2>
If you do not have a list of duplicated names, you can also click <b>Find</b> to optionally find
duplicate names in the database.  This can take and EXHAUSTIVELY long time.  For smaller databases,
you should expect short wait times.  For a database of 500 names, the wait is under a minute, but 
for a database of 10,000 names, you can expect an hour or two and for a database approaching 
50,000 names, expect 12 or more hours.<br/><br/>
Once the software has found duplicates and the box is populated, simply click on a name from
above and the list on the left will be cleared and populated.  You can still add additional
names using the <b>Add</b> button.  Once you have all the names, simply click <b>Merge</b> and
use the same merge procedure as before.
