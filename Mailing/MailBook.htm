<h1>Mailing Address Book</h1>

<h3>Viewing all addresses</h3>
Here you can view all or a subset of your addresses.  To refresh the list with all the addresses,
click the <b>Show All</b> button.

<h3>Searching/Viewing a subset of addresses</h3>
To view a smaller selection of addresses, type in some text you wish to search for in
the <b>Search For</b> box and click <b>Search</b>.
<br/><br/>
For more powerful searches, you can put a ^ at the beginning of the text or a $ at the end
of it to indicate that you wish to search for those instances where your text is at the
beginning or end of a field.  That is, if you wish to find all of the zip codes that start
with 56, type "^56" in the search field, select <i>Zip</i> from the <i>In</i> box and click
<b>Search</b>.  Or, if you wish to search for all of the Cities that end in NJ, and not
just contain the letters "NJ", type "NJ$" into the box.  This will cause the search to
only select those that end in this text.

<h3>Printing the current list of addresess</h3>
You can print the currently displayed list of addresses by clicking on <b>Print Addresses</b>.<br/>
<font color=red size=-2>NOTE: It is always a good idea to look at the status bar at the bottom of the screen to see the number
of records displayed to get an idea of how many pages this will produce.</font>

<h3>Exporting the displayed addresses</h3>
After selecting this option, you will be asked whether you want a simple export or a more
complicated one.
<br><br>
Selecting the simple export will send the displayed addresses to a text file that 
will be separated by commas (or a comma separated values type file, or a .CSV).
This commonly accepted format will allow you to do a mail merge or import into 
nearly any other program you wish to use.
<br><br>
There is also an option to export only the selected records using the 
<a href='Export to Floppy.htm'>Export Mail</a> form.  This will not, however, export any fields
other than the standard mailing fields.

<h3>Editing an address</h3>
To edit an address, simply double click on the line and you will be brought to  the mailing
add/edit section.

<h3>Other Options...</h3>
If you wish to see other information about your mailing list such as the amount that has
been sold to customers, change the sorting, or to limit a list to the first 100 or so
items, click on <b>Other Options...</b> and a side panel will appear.<br/>

<h4>Customer Sales History</h4>
You can display the Cost of items sold, the selling price, or the approximate Gross Margin for
each of your customers.  You can also optionally set a from or a to date for these calculations.
Simply select the columns you wish to add and set the dates accordingly.  When you are done, click
on the <b>Update</b> button in the lower right.

<h4>Sorting and Counting</h4>
To limit the number of records returned or to change the default sorting method, select the
desired values from these two combo boxes.  To refresh your table, click <b>Update</b> in the lower
right.
<br/><font size=-2 color=green>Note that all of the various fields work together.  If you still have
items in the <i>Search For</i> field, these will be figured into your search as well.  Also, the
options you select under the <i>List Management</i> panel will stay in effect even if it
is no longer visible.<br/></font>

<h3>Exiting the Address Book</h3>
To exit the address book, click on <b>Menu</b>.
