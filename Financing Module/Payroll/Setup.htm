<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>Open the <b><i>Payroll</i></b> module for the proper store by 
entering L1 for Location 1 L2 for Location 2, etc.&nbsp; Enter the User ID and 
password&nbsp; (You must call Custom Design Software to get this code).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>To set up the Payroll Module, you will need to get all Federal, State, City 
and any other local tax tables.&nbsp; These are usually mailed to you directly 
each year.&nbsp; We try to maintain the Federal Tax tables but it is recommended 
that you review the tax tables yourself.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b><i><font size="4">Adding Tax Tables</font></i></b></p>
<p>Using the Michigan tax tables for reference, add your own tax tables for 
State, City and local taxes.&nbsp; Remember, use the ANNUAL chart.&nbsp; The 
computer backs the annual rate down to correct pay period.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To build a new State Tax Table, for example, Click on Administration; Tax 
Tables.&nbsp; Click on Add and you have a blank table screen.&nbsp; </p>
<p>First, use a 3 digit code to represent the tax table.&nbsp; For example MIU 
would stand for Michigan Unemployment.&nbsp; Next type in the full description.&nbsp; 
Then the abbreviated description that will be printed on the checks.&nbsp; Mi 
SUTA would stand for Michigan State Unemployment Tax.&nbsp; Fill out the table 
or enter a percentage as your tax requires.&nbsp; Please don't forget to click 
on the correct dot on the right side for State unemployment or State Withholding 
as the case may be.&nbsp; When you finished with the table, click Add.&nbsp; 
This sets the table in the database.&nbsp; Finally, if there are no more tables 
to add, click Stop Add to finish.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><i>Adding Employees</i></font></b></p>
<p>To add your employees, click on Administration; Employee Maintenance.&nbsp; 
Click Add to start entering employee.&nbsp; For the Employee Code, use up to 8 
characters to abbreviate the employees name.&nbsp; Do <b>NOT </b>use their 
employee number as in the sample below.&nbsp; Enter the employees data as 
indicated.&nbsp; Be sure to be exact as the software will print out W-2's at the 
end of the year.&nbsp; Select Shift 1 from the drop down.&nbsp; Frequency is how 
often you pay the employee.&nbsp; Type is Salary, Hourly etc.&nbsp; Rate is 
extremely important for the software to work correctly.&nbsp; If the employee is 
Salary, then put in the <b>ANNUAL SALARY </b>not the weekly salary.&nbsp; For 
Standard hours, put in 40.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b><font size="4">Tax Code Button </font></b></i> </p>
<p>If you have any additional taxes to deduct from each employee, click on the 
Tax Codes button.&nbsp; The following blank screen appears.&nbsp; This screen 
may not be used by all employees if they don't have any additional taxed to 
deduct.&nbsp; On the first line, enter the abbreviation for the tax to be 
deducted.&nbsp; In this case, Michigan Withholding.&nbsp; Fill in the 
Liabilities and expenses as indicated.&nbsp; Notice that the State Unemployment 
is listed a the bottom.&nbsp; Click the Ok when complete.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b><font size="4">Special Deductions</font></b></i></p>
<p>If the employee has any &quot;Special Deductions&quot; such as Medical Insurance, 
Profit Sharing, or Child support have to be set up in the database before they 
can be used.&nbsp; This can be found under Administration; Module Options, and 
then click the Special Deductions button.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="Default%20Payroll%20Deductions.bmp"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, back to the employees page, click on the Deductions Button.&nbsp; Fill 
out per sample below.&nbsp; Again, this is for EACH EMPLOYEE.&nbsp; Any 
additional deductions not in our Chart Of Accounts must be added there first.&nbsp; 
Click Ok when complete.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b><font size="4">QTD / YTD Button </font></b></i> </p>
<p>If you do not start the Payroll on January 1, then you must enter the 
previous quarters earnings.&nbsp; It is recommended that you start the payroll 
at the beginning of a quarter as you will have the earnings already calculated 
manually.&nbsp; Click on the QTD / YTD Button.&nbsp; Fill in the form as shown.</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deduction 1 = FICA</li>

		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deduction 3 = Federal Withholding</li>
		<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deduction 4 = State Withholding</li>
