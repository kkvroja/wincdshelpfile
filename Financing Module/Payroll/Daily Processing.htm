<h1>Payroll Weekly Processing</h1>

	location to log into.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>

	<li>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="Payroll%20Start%20Processing.bmp"></li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">From the blank form which appears, enter the Check Date, Period Start, 
	and Period End dates.</li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">For each employee, enter the Department number the employee was 
	primarily in.&nbsp; select the employee name from the drop down.</li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">This employee worked 48 hours including 8 hours of overtime.&nbsp; 
	Notice that in Shift 1, we entered 48 hours.&nbsp; The software 
	automatically filled the Overtime 1 with 8 hours.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">Click on the Add button.&nbsp; This set the transaction into the 
	database.</li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">Continue with all the employees.&nbsp; Note: Salary employees get 
	automatically filled at 40 hours.&nbsp; This is correct.</li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">On the final employee, click OK.&nbsp; This puts you back to the main 
	menu.</li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">Now that all the employees are entered, click on <b>Processing; 
	Calculate Payroll </b>button.&nbsp; Then clik process Payroll. This actually 
	adds Taxes and all deductions.</li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><b>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!&nbsp; </b>Make a Payroll back Up 
	<b>NOW!&nbsp;
	</b>If you have a printer jam, or something goes wrong you will not have to 
	void a lot of payroll checks that cannot be used again even if they are 
	blank.</li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">After you review the printed checks for deductions and earnings, click 
	on <b>Reports</b>, <b>Check Register</b> and print out the check register 
	for the checks just printed.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">If we are at the end of a quarter, click on <b>Reports, 
	</b>and print 
	out the 941, F.U.T., S.U.T. reports.&nbsp; At year end, you can even print 
	out W-2's from the software.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note: </b>The process of printing W-2's can be done at any time after the 
end of the calendar year. The data that is used to generate the W-2's is the 
payroll transactions that made up all the checks through the year. This 
information is never deleted, so you don't have to rush to print W-2's between 
the last payroll for a year and the first payroll for the new year.</p>
