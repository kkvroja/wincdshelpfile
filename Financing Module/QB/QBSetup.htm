<h1>QB Setup - QuickBooks Interface</h1>

<h3>Before Setup</h3>
If you open the QuickBooks Interface panel from the General Ledger dropdown on the Main Menu without 
properly setting up the interface, you will see a yellow warning label and the following message:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
To use this, follow the following instructions and which will guide you through your one-time setup.



<h3>Setting Up The Interface</h3>
<ol>
<li><h4>Setting Up WinCDS</h4>
The first step you must do to set up your QuickBooks interface is to enable it in Store Setup.<br/>
Open store setup and go to the options tab.  You should see a grayed out QuickBooks box with no
check-mark.<br/>
<img src='QB-No.bmp'><br/>
<br/>
Click on this check-box and it will become checked and colored in as such:<br/>
<img src='QB-Yes.bmp'><br/>
<br/>
This will indicate to WinCDS that you desire to use QuickBooks for your accounting, but WinCDS must know the
file name, the accounts, and setup other important information before you can begin using it.
<br/><br/>
</li>
<li><h4>Setting up the QuickBooks Company</h4>
The second step in setting up your QuickBooks interface is to be sure that your QuickBooks company file will
accept connections from WinCDS.  To enable this, follow these steps:
  <ol>
  <li>Open your QuickBooks company.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>In WinCDS, open the QuickBooks Interface panel from the General Ledger Menu.  You should see the following:<br/>
<img src='QB-NotSetup.bmp'><br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>You must now specify for WinCDS to connect to your QuickBooks company.  Enter the filename of
      your company datafile into the box labeled <i>Company File</i>.  Tab off this box and you will
      receive notification that WinCDS is attempting to connect to your Company File.<br/>
      <img src='QB-Connecting.bmp'/><br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>Once you see the connecting message, QuickBooks should respond with a security warning.  This
      indicates that it has detected a program attempting to connect to its data file.  Verify your company
      name and that the application attempting to access the file is called
      <b><u>WinCDS POS for Furniture Stores</u></b>.  Enable the checkbox at the bottom of the box that
      says <i>Allow this application to access Social Security Numbers, customer credit card information,
      and other personal data</i>.  Then, click <i>Yes, <u>A</u>lways</i> to allow WinCDS to access your data.<br/>

  </li>
  <li>
   When you click to accept, you will be asked to confirm your choice to proceed.
   <font size=-1 color=red>NOTE:  If you do not authorize WinCDs to access
   your data, we will not have access to interface our accounting with your company file.</font>  
   Be sure to read the notice and click <i>Yes</i> to proceed.  <br/>

   <br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>
  Now you must finish setting up the options for this application.  Go to the <i>Edit</i> menu in QuickBooks
  and select <i>Preferences</i>.  On the left of the form, scroll to and select <i>Integrated Applications</i>
  and go to the <b>Company Preferences</b> tab.  This shows you the complete list of applications
  that are allowed to integrate with your company's data.  If you have successfully carried out the
  above instructions, you should see the entry <b>WinCDS POS for Furniture Stores</b> in the list.  Select
  this entry and click on the <b>Properties...</b> button to the right of the list.<br/>  
  <img src='QB-IntegratedApplications.bmp'>
  <br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>In order for WinCDS to access the data without having QuickBooks open in the background, it must be
  given permission by you to login automatically.  Click the box labled <i>Allow this application to login
  automatically</i>.  Click <b>OK</b> to exit out of the properties, and again to exit the Preferences screen/
  Integrated Applications list.<br/>
  <img src='QB-AllowAutomaticLogin.bmp'><br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>Your QuickBooks company is now set up to allow WinCDS to connect freely!</li>
  </ol>
<br/>
</li>
<li><h4>Creating Location Classes</h4>
WinCDS will export all of its data with classes that reflect the store number.  Click the
<b>Create Loc Classes</b> to allow WinCDS to create these classes automatically.
</li>
<li><h4>Creating special customers</h4>
WinCDS uses a dummy customer called 'Customer Deposits' for tracking bank deposits.  Click <b>Create
Special Customer Accounts</b> to create this account automatically.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li><h4>Transfering Vendors</h4>
Generally, you will have all of your vendors already set up in QuickBooks.  If this is the case, you can
skip this step.  WinCDS needs all of its vendors to exist in QuickBooks.  If you do not have the
vendors existing in QuickBooks, you can click on <b>Transfer Vendors</b> to automatically transfer all of
your vendors.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li><h4>Setting up your Account Mapping</h4>
To set up a single account, select it from the list.  Below, you will see the account name, number, and type.
Either select an existing QuickBooks account from the drop-down box or a new account.  If you want to create
a new account, you can also specify an account number.  You must click <b>Create Acct</b>.  If the account already
exists, simply tab off your selection.<br/>
Do this for all the accounts specified.
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
Alternatively, Click on <b>Create All Accounts</b> to automatically create all the required accounts.  Note that
each transaction to QuickBooks may take a while, so this operation could take a minute or two.  Wait until
you are notified that the process is complete.
<br/><br/>
</li>
<li><h4>Confirming your QB Setup</h4>
To confirm that your QuickBooks interface is properly setup, open the Interface panel (from the General Ledger
drop down on the Main Menu).  You should see a green status indicator and a status message indicating
<i>Status OK</i>.<br/>
